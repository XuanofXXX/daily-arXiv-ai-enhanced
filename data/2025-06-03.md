Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了PHYSICS数据集，包含16,568个高质量物理问题，涵盖多个领域和难度级别，旨在提升大型语言模型在物理推理任务中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理作为推理密集型且对现实世界理解至关重要的学科，在学术和工业界关注较少，因此需要专门的数据集和评估方法来推动LLMs在该领域的发展。

Method: 通过精心设计的质量控制流程从100多本教科书中筛选问题，构建PHYSICS数据集，并分为训练集和测试集。训练集包含由强推理模型生成的推理路径，同时提出Rule+Model评估框架以解决现有评估方法的偏差问题。

Result: 评估显示当前最先进的模型在处理物理任务时存在局限性，表明PHYSICS数据集和评估方法的必要性。

Conclusion: PHYSICS数据集和Rule+Model评估框架有望共同推动LLMs在物理领域的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on advanced
reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding competitions. Meanwhile,
physics, despite being both reasoning-intensive and essential to real-world
understanding, received limited academic and industrial attention. This paper
introduces PHYSICS, a dataset containing 16,568 high-quality physics problems
spanning subjects and difficulty levels, to facilitate this issue.
Specifically, PHYSICS is curated with exercises from over 100 textbooks through
a carefully designed pipeline for quality control. It covers five major physics
domains: Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Thermodynamics, Optics, and Modern
Physics. It also spans a wide range of difficulty levels, from high school to
graduate-level physics courses. To utilize the data for improving and
evaluating the model's physical reasoning capabilities, we split the dataset
into training and test sets, and provide reasoning paths generated by powerful
reasoning models for the training data to facilitate model training. In
addition, for the evaluation part, we find that existing evaluation frameworks
exhibit biases in aspects such as units, simplification, and precision in
physics domain. To balance efficiency and accuracy, we introduce a Rule+Model
evaluation framework tailored to physics problems. Our evaluations on current
state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models highlight the limitations
of current models in handling physics-related tasks. We hope that our dataset
and evaluation methodology will jointly advance the development of LLMs in the
field of physics.

### [3] [From Mathematical Reasoning to Code: Generalization of Process Reward Models in Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00027)
*Zhengyu Chen,Yudong Wang,Teng Xiao,Ruochen Zhou,Xuesheng Yang,Wei Wang,Zhifang Sui,Jingang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，过程奖励模型（PRMs）在提升大型语言模型推理能力方面有效，但模型规模增加会带来收益递减，需平衡计算成本与性能。训练数据多样性对PRM性能至关重要，而测试时策略（如蒙特卡洛树搜索）在不同资源条件下表现各异。PRMs在数学和代码生成任务中表现出跨领域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索PRMs在提升语言模型推理能力中的作用，分析其训练方法、可扩展性和泛化能力，以优化模型性能与计算效率的平衡。

Method: 通过分析PRMs的训练方法、FLOPs分配、数据集多样性及测试时策略（如蒙特卡洛树搜索和Best-of-N采样），评估其对复杂推理任务的影响。

Result: PRMs规模增加会带来收益递减；数据多样性显著提升性能；蒙特卡洛树搜索在资源充足时最优，Best-of-N采样适用于资源有限场景；PRMs在数学与代码任务中泛化能力强。

Conclusion: PRMs在提升推理能力方面有效，但需平衡规模与成本；数据多样性和测试策略是关键；跨领域泛化能力显著，为优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models have underscored the efficacy of Process Reward Models (PRMs) in
addressing intermediate errors through structured feedback mechanisms. This
study analyzes PRMs from multiple perspectives, including training
methodologies, scalability, and generalization capabilities. We investigate the
interplay between pre-training and reward model training FLOPs to assess their
influence on PRM efficiency and accuracy in complex reasoning tasks. Our
analysis reveals a pattern of diminishing returns in performance with
increasing PRM scale, highlighting the importance of balancing model size and
computational cost. Furthermore, the diversity of training datasets
significantly impacts PRM performance, emphasizing the importance of diverse
data to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. We further examine test-time
scaling strategies, identifying Monte Carlo Tree Search as the most effective
method when computational resources are abundant, while Best-of-N Sampling
serves as a practical alternative under resource-limited conditions. Notably,
our findings indicate that PRMs trained on mathematical datasets exhibit
performance comparable to those tailored for code generation, suggesting robust
cross-domain generalization. Employing a gradient-based metric, we observe that
PRMs exhibit a preference for selecting responses with similar underlying
patterns, further informing their optimization.

### [4] [Enhancing Tool Learning in Large Language Models with Hierarchical Error Checklists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00042)
*Yue Cui,Liuyi Yao,Shuchang Tao,Weijie Shi,Yaliang Li,Bolin Ding,Xiaofang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了HiTEC框架，通过全局和局部错误清单诊断和缓解工具调用错误，显著提升了参数填充准确性和工具调用成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在工具调用中常因参数填充错误而受限，需系统性解决方案。

Method: HiTEC采用两层级错误清单（全局和局部），并提出了HiTEC-ICL和HiTEC-KTO两种部署方法。

Result: 在五个公开数据集上，框架显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HiTEC有效解决了工具调用中的参数错误问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language
processing, particularly through the integration of external tools and APIs.
However, their effectiveness is frequently hampered by parameter mis-filling
during tool calling. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical Tool Error
Checklist (HiTEC) framework to systematically diagnose and mitigate
tool-calling errors without relying on extensive real-world interactions. HiTEC
introduces a two-tiered approach: a global error checklist that identifies
common, cross-tool issues, and a local error checklist that targets
tool-specific and contextual failures. Building on this structure, we propose
two deployments: HiTEC-In Context Learning (HiTEC-ICL) and
HiTEC-Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (HiTEC-KTO). HiTEC-ICL embeds the global
checklist in the initial prompts and leverages a two-round conversational
interaction to dynamically refine parameter handling, while HiTEC-KTO generates
high-quality negative examples to drive fine-tuning via preference-based
optimization. Extensive experiments across five public datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly improves parameter-filling accuracy and
tool-calling success rates compared to baseline methods.

### [5] [Unraveling SITT: Social Influence Technique Taxonomy and Detection with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00061)
*Wiktoria Mieleszczenko-Kowszewicz,Beata Bajcar,Aleksander Szczęsny,Maciej Markiewicz,Jolanta Babiak,Berenika Dyczek,Przemysław Kazienko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Social Influence Technique Taxonomy (SITT)，一个包含58种技术的框架，用于检测文本中的社会影响，并评估了LLMs识别这些技术的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在填补LLMs在识别微妙社会影响技术方面的能力空白，并提供一个跨学科的评估框架。

Method: 构建了SITT数据集（746个对话），采用分层多标签分类方法，评估了五种LLMs（如GPT-4o、Claude 3.5等）的性能。

Result: Claude 3.5表现最佳（F1=0.45），但整体模型性能有限，尤其是对上下文敏感的技术。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs对细微语言线索的敏感性不足，强调了领域特定微调的重要性，为研究社会影响的检测和分类提供了新资源。

Abstract: In this work we present the Social Influence Technique Taxonomy (SITT), a
comprehensive framework of 58 empirically grounded techniques organized into
nine categories, designed to detect subtle forms of social influence in textual
content. We also investigate the LLMs ability to identify various forms of
social influence. Building on interdisciplinary foundations, we construct the
SITT dataset -- a 746-dialogue corpus annotated by 11 experts in Polish and
translated into English -- to evaluate the ability of LLMs to identify these
techniques. Using a hierarchical multi-label classification setup, we benchmark
five LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Llama-3.1, Mixtral, and PLLuM. Our
results show that while some models, notably Claude 3.5, achieved moderate
success (F1 score = 0.45 for categories), overall performance of models remains
limited, particularly for context-sensitive techniques. The findings
demonstrate key limitations in current LLMs' sensitivity to nuanced linguistic
cues and underscore the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning. This work
contributes a novel resource and evaluation example for understanding how LLMs
detect, classify, and potentially replicate strategies of social influence in
natural dialogues.

### [6] [Mis-prompt: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Proactive Error Handling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00064)
*Jiayi Zeng,Yizhe Feng,Mengliang He,Wenhui Lei,Wei Zhang,Zeming Liu,Xiaoming Shi,Aimin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种主动错误处理方法，无需显式错误处理指令，并引入了新的基准Mis-prompt，包含四项任务、错误分类法和数据集。实验表明当前LLMs在主动错误处理上表现不佳，但通过SFT可以提升能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中通常缺乏显式错误处理指令，当前LLMs的被动错误处理方法无法满足需求。

Method: 提出Mis-prompt基准，包含四项任务、错误分类法和数据集，并通过SFT优化LLMs的主动错误处理能力。

Result: 实验显示当前LLMs在主动错误处理上表现不佳，但SFT能显著提升其能力。

Conclusion: 论文为主动错误处理提供了新基准和方法，展示了SFT的有效性，并公开数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in
error handling. Current error-handling works are performed in a passive manner,
with explicit error-handling instructions. However, in real-world scenarios,
explicit error-handling instructions are usually unavailable. In this paper,
our work identifies this challenge as how to conduct proactive error handling
without explicit error handling instructions. To promote further research, this
work introduces a new benchmark, termed Mis-prompt, consisting of four
evaluation tasks, an error category taxonomy, and a new evaluation dataset.
Furthermore, this work analyzes current LLMs' performance on the benchmark, and
the experimental results reveal that current LLMs show poor performance on
proactive error handling, and SFT on error handling instances improves LLMs'
proactive error handling capabilities. The dataset will be publicly available.

### [7] [You Prefer This One, I Prefer Yours: Using Reference Words is Harder Than Vocabulary Words for Humans and Multimodal Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00065)
*Dota Tianai Dong,Yifan Luo,Po-Ya Angela Wang,Asli Ozyurek,Paula Rubio-Fernandez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了多模态语言模型（MLMs）在参考词使用上的表现，发现其在需要认知能力的代词（如物主代词和指示代词）使用上明显落后于人类，揭示了模型在视角转换和空间推理上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLMs在人类化交流中表现突出，但其参考词使用能力尚未被充分研究，而这些词在日常交流中非常普遍。

Method: 通过比较人类和七种先进MLMs在词汇、物主代词和指示代词任务上的表现，评估模型的认知能力。

Result: MLMs在词汇任务上接近人类水平，但在物主代词和指示代词任务上表现较差，尤其是后者。提示工程改善了物主代词的表现，但指示代词仍远低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 当前NLP系统在处理需要语用学和社会认知的语法形式时仍面临挑战，尤其是在视角转换和空间推理方面。

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) increasingly communicate in human-like
ways, yet their ability to use reference words remains largely overlooked
despite their ubiquity in everyday communication. Our study addresses this gap
by comparing human and MLM use of three word classes with increasing cognitive
demands: vocabulary words, possessive pronouns (`mine' vs `yours'), and
demonstrative pronouns (`this one' vs `that one'). Evaluating seven
state-of-the-art MLMs against human participants, we observe a clear difficulty
hierarchy: while MLMs approach human-level performance on the vocabulary task,
they show substantial deficits with possessives and demonstratives. Our
analysis reveals these difficulties stem from limitations in perspective-taking
and spatial reasoning. Although prompt engineering improved model performance
on possessive use, demonstrative use remained well below human-level
competence. These findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence that
producing grammatical forms requiring pragmatics and social cognition remains a
clear challenge in current NLP systems.

### [8] [Probing Politico-Economic Bias in Multilingual Large Language Models: A Cultural Analysis of Low-Resource Pakistani Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00068)
*Afrozah Nadeem,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了13种最先进的大型语言模型（LLM）在巴基斯坦五种低资源语言中的政治偏见，提出了一种结合定量和定性分析的新框架，发现LLM主要偏向自由左翼价值观，但在区域语言中表现出明显的威权倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探讨LLM在非西方和低资源多语言环境中的政治经济偏见，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 方法包括结合改进的政治指南针测试（PCT）和多层次框架分析，定量评估政治倾向（经济和社会轴）及定性分析内容、风格和重点。

Result: 结果显示LLM主要反映西方训练数据的自由左翼倾向，但在区域语言中转向威权框架，表明文化调制效应显著。

Conclusion: 结论强调需要基于文化的多语言偏见审计框架，以应对LLM的意识形态表达差异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping public discourse, yet
their politico-economic biases remain underexamined in non-Western and
low-resource multilingual contexts. This paper presents a systematic analysis
of political bias in 13 state-of-the-art LLMs across five low-resource
languages spoken in Pakistan: Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Balochi, and Pashto. We
propose a novel framework that integrates an adapted Political Compass Test
(PCT) with a multi-level framing analysis. Our method combines quantitative
assessment of political orientation across economic (left-right) and social
(libertarian-authoritarian) axes with qualitative analysis of framing through
content, style, and emphasis. We further contextualize this analysis by
aligning prompts with 11 key socio-political themes relevant to Pakistani
society. Our results reveal that LLMs predominantly align with liberal-left
values, echoing Western training data influences, but exhibit notable shifts
toward authoritarian framing in regional languages, suggesting strong cultural
modulation effects. We also identify consistent model-specific bias signatures
and language-conditioned variations in ideological expression. These findings
show the urgent need for culturally grounded, multilingual bias auditing
frameworks.

### [9] [Evaluating the Sensitivity of LLMs to Prior Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00069)
*Robert Hankache,Kingsley Nketia Acheampong,Liang Song,Marek Brynda,Raad Khraishi,Greig A. Cowan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在多轮对话中的性能表现，发现上下文变化会显著影响其准确性，并提出了一种新的基准测试方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注单轮问答任务，无法捕捉多轮对话对LLMs性能的影响，因此需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 引入了一组新的基准测试，系统地改变上下文的量和性质，并评估了多种LLMs（如GPT、Claude和Gemini）在这些测试中的表现。

Result: 研究发现，多轮对话中LLMs的性能可能大幅下降（某些模型下降73%），且模型大小与性能的关系并不总是可预测的。任务描述的放置位置对性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究强调了设计、评估和减轻LLMs上下文相关敏感性的重要性，并提出了改进策略。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-turn
dialogue and other sustained interactive scenarios, it is essential to
understand how extended context affects their performance. Popular benchmarks,
focusing primarily on single-turn question answering (QA) tasks, fail to
capture the effects of multi-turn exchanges. To address this gap, we introduce
a novel set of benchmarks that systematically vary the volume and nature of
prior context. We evaluate multiple conventional LLMs, including GPT, Claude,
and Gemini, across these benchmarks to measure their sensitivity to contextual
variations. Our findings reveal that LLM performance on multiple-choice
questions can degrade dramatically in multi-turn interactions, with performance
drops as large as 73% for certain models. Even highly capable models such as
GPT-4o exhibit up to a 32% decrease in accuracy. Notably, the relative
performance of larger versus smaller models is not always predictable.
Moreover, the strategic placement of the task description within the context
can substantially mitigate performance drops, improving the accuracy by as much
as a factor of 3.5. These findings underscore the need for robust strategies to
design, evaluate, and mitigate context-related sensitivity in LLMs.

### [10] [Gaussian mixture models as a proxy for interacting language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00077)
*Edward Wang,Tianyu Wang,Avanti Athreya,Vince Lyzinski,Carey E. Priebe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出使用交互高斯混合模型（GMMs）作为大型语言模型（LLMs）的替代方案，用于社会科学中人类行为研究。通过比较GMMs和LLMs的动态特征，发现GMMs能捕捉LLMs交互中的关键特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在社会科学中用于研究人类行为，但其计算复杂且昂贵。因此，作者探索GMMs作为更高效的替代方案。

Method: 引入交互GMMs，并将其与LLMs在实验模拟中进行比较，分析动态特征的相似性和差异。

Result: 交互GMMs能够捕捉LLMs交互中的关键动态特征。

Conclusion: GMMs具有潜力作为LLMs的替代方案，未来可进一步优化和研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are a powerful tool with the ability to match
human capabilities and behavior in many settings. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) further allows LLMs to generate diverse output depending on
the contents of their RAG database. This motivates their use in the social
sciences to study human behavior between individuals when large-scale
experiments are infeasible. However, LLMs depend on complex, computationally
expensive algorithms. In this paper, we introduce interacting Gaussian mixture
models (GMMs) as an alternative to similar frameworks using LLMs. We compare a
simplified model of GMMs to select experimental simulations of LLMs whose
updating and response depend on feedback from other LLMs. We find that
interacting GMMs capture important features of the dynamics in interacting
LLMs, and we investigate key similarities and differences between interacting
LLMs and GMMs. We conclude by discussing the benefits of Gaussian mixture
models, potential modifications, and future research directions.

*Vincent Siu,Nicholas Crispino,Zihao Yu,Sam Pan,Zhun Wang,Yang Liu,Dawn Song,Chenguang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COSMIC是一种自动框架，通过余弦相似度识别拒绝行为方向，无需依赖模型输出或预设模板，性能媲美现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预设模板或人工分析，难以有效识别大型语言模型中的拒绝行为。

Method: 利用余弦相似度选择方向和目标层，完全独立于模型输出。

Result: 在对抗性环境和弱对齐模型中可靠识别拒绝方向，并能引导模型更安全，假拒绝率增加极少。

Conclusion: COSMIC在不同对齐条件下表现稳健，为识别和引导拒绝行为提供了高效自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode behaviors such as refusal within their
activation space, yet identifying these behaviors remains a significant
challenge. Existing methods often rely on predefined refusal templates
detectable in output tokens or require manual analysis. We introduce
\textbf{COSMIC} (Cosine Similarity Metrics for Inversion of Concepts), an
automated framework for direction selection that identifies viable steering
directions and target layers using cosine similarity - entirely independent of
model outputs. COSMIC achieves steering performance comparable to prior methods
without requiring assumptions about a model's refusal behavior, such as the
presence of specific refusal tokens. It reliably identifies refusal directions
in adversarial settings and weakly aligned models, and is capable of steering
such models toward safer behavior with minimal increase in false refusals,
demonstrating robustness across a wide range of alignment conditions.

*Peng Xie,Xingyuan Liu,Tsz Wai Chan,Yequan Bie,Yangqiu Song,Yang Wang,Hao Chen,Kani Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了LinguaMaster框架和SwitchLingua数据集，填补了多语言代码切换研究的数据空白，并提出了新的评估指标SAER。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码切换数据集规模小且多样性不足，无法满足多语言应用需求，亟需类似ImageNet的大规模基准数据集。

Method: 通过多智能体协作框架LinguaMaster合成大规模多语言数据，构建SwitchLingua数据集，并提出SAER评估指标。

Result: SwitchLingua包含420K文本样本和80小时音频，覆盖12种语言和63种种族背景；SAER能更准确评估代码切换场景下的ASR性能。

Conclusion: LinguaMaster和SwitchLingua为多语言研究提供了重要资源，SAER提升了评估的准确性。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) is the alternating use of two or more languages within a
conversation or utterance, often influenced by social context and speaker
identity. This linguistic phenomenon poses challenges for Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) systems, which are typically designed for a single language
and struggle to handle multilingual inputs. The growing global demand for
multilingual applications, including Code-Switching ASR (CSASR), Text-to-Speech
(CSTTS), and Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR), highlights the
inadequacy of existing monolingual datasets.
  Although some code-switching datasets exist, most are limited to bilingual
mixing within homogeneous ethnic groups, leaving a critical need for a
large-scale, diverse benchmark akin to ImageNet in computer vision.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{LinguaMaster}, a multi-agent
collaboration framework specifically designed for efficient and scalable
multilingual data synthesis. Leveraging this framework, we curate
\textbf{SwitchLingua}, the first large-scale multilingual and multi-ethnic
code-switching dataset, including: (1) 420K CS textual samples across 12
languages, and (2) over 80 hours of audio recordings from 174 speakers
representing 18 countries/regions and 63 racial/ethnic backgrounds, based on
the textual data. This dataset captures rich linguistic and cultural diversity,
offering a foundational resource for advancing multilingual and multicultural
research. Furthermore, to address the issue that existing ASR evaluation
metrics lack sensitivity to code-switching scenarios, we propose the
\textbf{Semantic-Aware Error Rate (SAER)}, a novel evaluation metric that
incorporates semantic information, providing a more accurate and context-aware
assessment of system performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法HD-NDEs，通过神经微分方程在LLMs的潜在空间中检测幻觉问题，显著提升了检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于分类的方法（如SAPLMA）在检测LLMs生成的早期或中间序列中的非事实信息时效果不佳，需要更可靠的方法。

Method: 使用神经微分方程（Neural DEs）建模LLMs潜在空间的动态系统，并将潜在空间序列映射到分类空间进行真实性评估。

Result: 在五个数据集和六种LLMs上的实验表明，HD-NDEs在True-False数据集上的AUC-ROC比现有技术提高了14%以上。

Conclusion: HD-NDEs是一种有效的幻觉检测方法，尤其在处理LLMs生成的非事实信息时表现优异。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable
advancements, yet hallucination, where models produce inaccurate or non-factual
statements, remains a significant challenge for real-world deployment. Although
current classification-based methods, such as SAPLMA, are highly efficient in
mitigating hallucinations, they struggle when non-factual information arises in
the early or mid-sequence of outputs, reducing their reliability. To address
these issues, we propose Hallucination Detection-Neural Differential Equations
(HD-NDEs), a novel method that systematically assesses the truthfulness of
statements by capturing the full dynamics of LLMs within their latent space.
Our approaches apply neural differential equations (Neural DEs) to model the
dynamic system in the latent space of LLMs. Then, the sequence in the latent
space is mapped to the classification space for truth assessment. The extensive
experiments across five datasets and six widely used LLMs demonstrate the
effectiveness of HD-NDEs, especially, achieving over 14% improvement in AUC-ROC
on the True-False dataset compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Motivation: 现有方法在非可验证任务中依赖人类偏好的标量奖励模型，存在泛化性差和奖励黑客问题，亟需一种统一的方法。

Method: 提出基于写作原则的成对GenRM和BRPO算法，将主观评估转化为可靠奖励，并通过动态参考优化策略。

Result: Writing-Zero模型在写作任务中表现优于标量奖励基线，且对奖励黑客问题有强抵抗力。

Conclusion: RLVR框架有望统一基于规则、参考和无参考的奖励建模，为语言任务提供全面的RL训练范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has enabled large
language models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning tasks
with objective ground-truth answers, such as mathematics and code generation.
However, a significant gap remains for non-verifiable tasks, like creative
writing and open-ended dialogue, where quality assessment is inherently
subjective and lacks definitive references. Existing approaches for these
domains often rely on scalar reward models trained with human preferences,
which suffer from limited generalization and are prone to reward hacking, such
as over-explanation and length bias. In this work, we propose a unified
RLVR-based training paradigm that bridges the gap between non-verifiable tasks
and verifiable rewards. We introduce a writing-principle-based pairwise
Generative Reward Model (GenRM) and a novel Bootstrapped Relative Policy
Optimization (BRPO) algorithm. The pairwise writing GenRM leverages
self-principled critique to transform subjective assessments into reliable,
verifiable rewards, while BRPO enables dynamic, reference-free pairwise
comparison by leveraging a bootstrapped response as temporary reference from
within group rollouts during RL training. Our approach empowers LLMs to develop
robust writing capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as demonstrated by
Writing-Zero, which shows consistent improvement and strong resistance to
reward hacking compared to scalar reward baselines. Furthermore, our method
achieves competitive results on both in-house and open-source writing
benchmarks. Our findings suggest the potential to unify rule-based,
reference-based, and reference-free reward modeling under the RLVR framework,
thus paving the way for a comprehensive and scalable RL training paradigm
applicable across all language tasks.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了从临床文本中提取社会健康决定因素（SDOH）时，大型语言模型（LLMs）可能因依赖表面线索而产生虚假预测的问题，并提出缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决LLMs在提取SDOH时因依赖表面线索（如酒精或吸烟提及）而导致的虚假预测问题，并揭示模型性能中的性别差异。

Method: 使用SHAC数据集中的MIMIC部分，以药物状态提取为例，评估LLMs的预测偏差，并测试提示工程和链式思维推理等缓解策略。

Result: 研究发现酒精或吸烟的提及会误导模型预测当前/过去的药物使用，同时揭示了模型性能中的性别差异。缓解策略部分有效。

Conclusion: 通过提示工程和链式思维推理等策略，可以部分减少LLMs在健康领域的虚假预测，提升其可靠性。

Abstract: Social determinants of health (SDOH) extraction from clinical text is
critical for downstream healthcare analytics. Although large language models
(LLMs) have shown promise, they may rely on superficial cues leading to
spurious predictions. Using the MIMIC portion of the SHAC (Social History
Annotation Corpus) dataset and focusing on drug status extraction as a case
study, we demonstrate that mentions of alcohol or smoking can falsely induce
models to predict current/past drug use where none is present, while also
uncovering concerning gender disparities in model performance. We further
evaluate mitigation strategies - such as prompt engineering and
chain-of-thought reasoning - to reduce these false positives, providing
insights into enhancing LLM reliability in health domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化在问答系统中至关重要，但相关研究较少，主要因缺乏训练和评估资源。

Method: 引入LaMP-QA基准，涵盖三大类问题，进行人工和自动评估，并比较多种评估策略。

Result: 个性化上下文可提升性能达39%。

Conclusion: LaMP-QA基准公开支持未来研究，个性化方法显著提升问答系统性能。

Abstract: Personalization is essential for question answering systems that are
user-centric. Despite its importance, personalization in answer generation has
been relatively underexplored. This is mainly due to lack of resources for
training and evaluating personalized question answering systems. We address
this gap by introducing LaMP-QA -- a benchmark designed for evaluating
personalized long-form answer generation. The benchmark covers questions from
three major categories: (1) Arts & Entertainment, (2) Lifestyle & Personal
Development, and (3) Society & Culture, encompassing over 45 subcategories in
total. To assess the quality and potential impact of the LaMP-QA benchmark for
personalized question answering, we conduct comprehensive human and automatic
evaluations, to compare multiple evaluation strategies for evaluating generated
personalized responses and measure their alignment with human preferences.
Furthermore, we benchmark a number of non-personalized and personalized
approaches based on open-source and proprietary large language models (LLMs).
Our results show that incorporating the personalized context provided leads to
performance improvements of up to 39%. The benchmark is publicly released to
support future research in this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梵语因其音素复杂性和语音转换特性，在ASR研究中未被充分探索，尤其是在诗歌韵律方面。

Method: 构建了一个包含30,779个标记音频样本的梵语ASR数据集，并在多种多语言语音模型上进行了基准测试。

Result: IndicWhisper在实验中表现最佳。

Conclusion: Vedavani填补了梵语ASR研究的空白，为梵语诗歌的语音识别提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Sanskrit, an ancient language with a rich linguistic heritage, presents
unique challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to its phonemic
complexity and the phonetic transformations that occur at word junctures,
similar to the connected speech found in natural conversations. Due to these
complexities, there has been limited exploration of ASR in Sanskrit,
particularly in the context of its poetic verses, which are characterized by
intricate prosodic and rhythmic patterns. This gap in research raises the
question: How can we develop an effective ASR system for Sanskrit, particularly
one that captures the nuanced features of its poetic form? In this study, we
introduce Vedavani, the first comprehensive ASR study focused on Sanskrit Vedic
poetry. We present a 54-hour Sanskrit ASR dataset, consisting of 30,779
labelled audio samples from the Rig Veda and Atharva Veda. This dataset
captures the precise prosodic and rhythmic features that define the language.
We also benchmark the dataset on various state-of-the-art multilingual speech
models.$^{1}$ Experimentation revealed that IndicWhisper performed the best
among the SOTA models.

Motivation: 随着LLM推理能力的提升，传统方法（如微调或提示工程）在狼人杀游戏中变得冗余，需要更简洁高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用优化的TTS模型与多种LLM结合，设计了一个新颖的狼人杀游戏系统。

Result: 系统提升了用户参与度和兼容性，同时减少了额外组件的需求。

Conclusion: 随着LLM推理能力的增强，未来狼人杀游戏系统可以更简洁高效。

Abstract: The growing popularity of social deduction game systems for both business
applications and AI research has greatly benefited from the rapid advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs), which now demonstrate stronger reasoning and
persuasion capabilities. Especially with the raise of DeepSeek R1 and V3
models, LLMs should enable a more engaging experience for human players in
LLM-agent-based social deduction games like Werewolf. Previous works either
fine-tuning, advanced prompting engineering, or additional experience pool to
achieve engaging text-format Werewolf game experience. We propose a novel yet
straightforward LLM-based Werewolf game system with tuned Text-to-Speech(TTS)
models designed for enhanced compatibility with various LLM models, and
improved user engagement. We argue with ever enhancing LLM reasoning, extra
components will be unnecessary in the case of Werewolf.

TL;DR: 研究发现，部分遵从（提供一般信息但不提供可操作细节）是最优的拒绝策略，能显著减少用户负面感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs对潜在有害查询的拒绝策略可能影响用户体验，需探索更优策略。

Method: 通过480名参与者评估3,840个查询-响应对，分析不同拒绝策略对用户感知的影响。

Result: 部分遵从策略减少负面感知50%以上，但现有模型和奖励模型未能充分利用。

Conclusion: 应优化拒绝策略而非意图检测，以实现安全与用户体验的平衡。

Abstract: Current LLMs are trained to refuse potentially harmful input queries
regardless of whether users actually had harmful intents, causing a tradeoff
between safety and user experience. Through a study of 480 participants
evaluating 3,840 query-response pairs, we examine how different refusal
strategies affect user perceptions across varying motivations. Our findings
reveal that response strategy largely shapes user experience, while actual user
motivation has negligible impact. Partial compliance -- providing general
information without actionable details -- emerges as the optimal strategy,
reducing negative user perceptions by over 50% to flat-out refusals.
Complementing this, we analyze response patterns of 9 state-of-the-art LLMs and
evaluate how 6 reward models score different refusal strategies, demonstrating
that models rarely deploy partial compliance naturally and reward models
currently undervalue it. This work demonstrates that effective guardrails
require focusing on crafting thoughtful refusals rather than detecting intent,
offering a path toward AI safety mechanisms that ensure both safety and
sustained user engagement.

TL;DR: 轻量级编码器-解码器模型（如T5和BERT2BERT）在结构化放射学报告中表现优于大型语言模型（LLMs），且计算资源消耗更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学报告缺乏标准化格式，限制了人类解读和机器学习应用。大型语言模型虽强大，但计算需求高、透明度低且存在隐私问题。

Method: 使用轻量级模型（<300M参数）和八种开源LLMs（1B-70B），通过前缀提示、上下文学习和LoRA微调进行对比。

Result: 轻量级模型在人类标注测试集上优于基于提示的LLMs。LoRA微调的LLMs在部分指标上略有提升，但资源消耗显著增加。

Conclusion: 轻量级模型是资源受限医疗环境中结构化临床文本的可持续且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Radiology reports are critical for clinical decision-making but often lack a
standardized format, limiting both human interpretability and machine learning
(ML) applications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong
capabilities in reformatting clinical text, their high computational
requirements, lack of transparency, and data privacy concerns hinder practical
deployment. To address these challenges, we explore lightweight encoder-decoder
models (<300M parameters)-specifically T5 and BERT2BERT-for structuring
radiology reports from the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus datasets. We benchmark
these models against eight open-source LLMs (1B-70B), adapted using prefix
prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and low-rank adaptation (LoRA)
finetuning. Our best-performing lightweight model outperforms all LLMs adapted
using prompt-based techniques on a human-annotated test set. While some
LoRA-finetuned LLMs achieve modest gains over the lightweight model on the
Findings section (BLEU 6.4%, ROUGE-L 4.8%, BERTScore 3.6%, F1-RadGraph 1.1%,
GREEN 3.6%, and F1-SRR-BERT 4.3%), these improvements come at the cost of
substantially greater computational resources. For example, LLaMA-3-70B
incurred more than 400 times the inference time, cost, and carbon emissions
compared to the lightweight model. These results underscore the potential of
lightweight, task-specific models as sustainable and privacy-preserving
solutions for structuring clinical text in resource-constrained healthcare
settings.

TL;DR: AST-FIM是一种利用抽象语法树（AST）的预训练策略，用于代码LLM，通过掩码完整语法结构提升代码填充任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM将代码视为纯文本并随机掩码字符，无法充分利用代码的语法结构。

Method: 提出AST-FIM，基于AST掩码完整语法结构，生成更符合代码编辑模式的训练样本。

Result: 在1B和8B参数模型上，AST-FIM在标准FIM基准测试中比随机字符掩码方法性能提升高达5分。

Conclusion: AST-FIM显著提升了代码填充任务的性能，适用于真实世界的代码编辑场景。

Abstract: Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) is a common pretraining method for code LLMs, where
models complete code segments given surrounding context. However, existing LLMs
treat code as plain text and mask random character spans. We propose and
evaluate AST-FIM, a pretraining strategy that leverages Abstract Syntax Trees
(ASTs) to mask complete syntactic structures at scale, ensuring coherent
training examples better aligned with universal code structures and common code
editing patterns such as blocks, expressions, or functions. To evaluate
real-world fill-in-the-middle (FIM) programming tasks, we introduce
Real-FIM-Eval, a benchmark derived from 30,000+ GitHub commits across 12
languages. On infilling tasks, experiments on 1B and 8B parameter models show
that AST-FIM is particularly beneficial for real-world code editing as it
outperforms standard random-character FIM by up to 5 pts on standard FIM
benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: REIC是一种基于检索增强生成的意图分类方法，解决了大规模客户服务中意图分类的可扩展性问题，无需频繁重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着公司产品线的扩展，意图分类面临意图数量增加和分类体系跨垂直领域变化的挑战。

Method: REIC利用检索增强生成（RAG）动态整合相关知识，实现精确分类。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，REIC优于传统的微调、零样本和少样本方法。

Conclusion: REIC在领域内和领域外场景中均表现出色，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Accurate intent classification is critical for efficient routing in customer
service, ensuring customers are connected with the most suitable agents while
reducing handling times and operational costs. However, as companies expand
their product lines, intent classification faces scalability challenges due to
the increasing number of intents and variations in taxonomy across different
verticals. In this paper, we introduce REIC, a Retrieval-augmented generation
Enhanced Intent Classification approach, which addresses these challenges
effectively. REIC leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to dynamically
incorporate relevant knowledge, enabling precise classification without the
need for frequent retraining. Through extensive experiments on real-world
datasets, we demonstrate that REIC outperforms traditional fine-tuning,
zero-shot, and few-shot methods in large-scale customer service settings. Our
results highlight its effectiveness in both in-domain and out-of-domain
scenarios, demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment in adaptive
and large-scale intent classification systems.

TL;DR: ComposeRAG提出了一种模块化的RAG系统设计，通过分解核心功能为独立模块，提升了多跳问答的准确性、可解释性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统设计过于单一，耦合度高，限制了其可解释性、系统评估和针对性改进，尤其是在复杂多跳问答任务中。

Method: 将RAG流程分解为原子化、可组合的模块（如问题分解、查询重写、检索决策和答案验证），并引入自反思机制以增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在四个多跳问答基准测试中，ComposeRAG在准确性和答案可靠性上均优于基线方法，最高提升15%准确率和10%的答案可靠性。

Conclusion: ComposeRAG通过模块化设计和自反思机制，实现了灵活、透明、可扩展且高性能的多跳推理，显著提升了答案的可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly diverse, yet
many suffer from monolithic designs that tightly couple core functions like
query reformulation, retrieval, reasoning, and verification. This limits their
interpretability, systematic evaluation, and targeted improvement, especially
for complex multi-hop question answering. We introduce ComposeRAG, a novel
modular abstraction that decomposes RAG pipelines into atomic, composable
modules. Each module, such as Question Decomposition, Query Rewriting,
Retrieval Decision, and Answer Verification, acts as a parameterized
transformation on structured inputs/outputs, allowing independent
implementation, upgrade, and analysis. To enhance robustness against errors in
multi-step reasoning, ComposeRAG incorporates a self-reflection mechanism that
iteratively revisits and refines earlier steps upon verification failure.
Evaluated on four challenging multi-hop QA benchmarks, ComposeRAG consistently
outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and grounding fidelity.
Specifically, it achieves up to a 15% accuracy improvement over
fine-tuning-based methods and up to a 5% gain over reasoning-specialized
pipelines under identical retrieval conditions. Crucially, ComposeRAG
significantly enhances grounding: its verification-first design reduces
ungrounded answers by over 10% in low-quality retrieval settings, and by
approximately 3% even with strong corpora. Comprehensive ablation studies
validate the modular architecture, demonstrating distinct and additive
contributions from each component. These findings underscore ComposeRAG's
capacity to deliver flexible, transparent, scalable, and high-performing
multi-hop reasoning with improved grounding and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗决策是AI最具挑战性的领域之一，需要整合多样化的知识源和复杂推理。现有AI系统要么适应性有限，要么缺乏专业知识支持。

Method: MedOrch采用模块化、基于代理的架构，灵活集成领域专用工具，并确保透明、可追溯的推理过程。

Result: 在阿尔茨海默病诊断、胸部X光解读和医学视觉问答等任务中，MedOrch表现优异，准确率显著提升。

Conclusion: MedOrch展示了通过推理驱动工具利用处理多模态医疗数据的潜力，有望推动医疗AI的发展。

Abstract: Healthcare decision-making represents one of the most challenging domains for
Artificial Intelligence (AI), requiring the integration of diverse knowledge
sources, complex reasoning, and various external analytical tools. Current AI
systems often rely on either task-specific models, which offer limited
adaptability, or general language models without grounding with specialized
external knowledge and tools. We introduce MedOrch, a novel framework that
orchestrates multiple specialized tools and reasoning agents to provide
comprehensive medical decision support. MedOrch employs a modular, agent-based
architecture that facilitates the flexible integration of domain-specific tools
without altering the core system. Furthermore, it ensures transparent and
traceable reasoning processes, enabling clinicians to meticulously verify each
intermediate step underlying the system's recommendations. We evaluate MedOrch
across three distinct medical applications: Alzheimer's disease diagnosis,
chest X-ray interpretation, and medical visual question answering, using
authentic clinical datasets. The results demonstrate MedOrch's competitive
performance across these diverse medical tasks. Notably, in Alzheimer's disease
diagnosis, MedOrch achieves an accuracy of 93.26%, surpassing the
state-of-the-art baseline by over four percentage points. For predicting
Alzheimer's disease progression, it attains a 50.35% accuracy, marking a
significant improvement. In chest X-ray analysis, MedOrch exhibits superior
performance with a Macro AUC of 61.2% and a Macro F1-score of 25.5%. Moreover,
in complex multimodal visual question answering (Image+Table), MedOrch achieves
an accuracy of 54.47%. These findings underscore MedOrch's potential to advance
healthcare AI by enabling reasoning-driven tool utilization for multimodal
medical data processing and supporting intricate cognitive tasks in clinical
decision-making.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在低资源语言（如波斯语）和高风险领域（如医学）中的可靠性。

Method: 使用PersianMedQA数据集，在零样本和思维链（CoT）设置下评估40多种模型。

Result: 闭源通用模型（如GPT-4.1）表现最佳，波斯语微调模型表现较差；翻译对性能有影响，模型大小不足以确保鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PersianMedQA为评估多语言和文化背景下的医学推理提供了基础，强调领域和语言适应的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on a wide
range of NLP benchmarks, often surpassing human-level accuracy. However, their
reliability in high-stakes domains such as medicine, particularly in
low-resource languages, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
PersianMedQA, a large-scale, expert-validated dataset of multiple-choice
Persian medical questions, designed to evaluate LLMs across both Persian and
English. We benchmark over 40 state-of-the-art models, including
general-purpose, Persian fine-tuned, and medical LLMs, in zero-shot and
chain-of-thought (CoT) settings. Our results show that closed-source general
models (e.g., GPT-4.1) consistently outperform all other categories, achieving
83.3% accuracy in Persian and 80.7% in English, while Persian fine-tuned models
such as Dorna underperform significantly (e.g., 35.9% in Persian), often
struggling with both instruction-following and domain reasoning. We also
analyze the impact of translation, showing that while English performance is
generally higher, Persian responses are sometimes more accurate due to cultural
and clinical contextual cues. Finally, we demonstrate that model size alone is
insufficient for robust performance without strong domain or language
adaptation. PersianMedQA provides a foundation for evaluating multilingual and
culturally grounded medical reasoning in LLMs. The PersianMedQA dataset can be

Motivation: 探讨对齐语言模型在隐性偏见测试中表现偏见的原因，并提出解决方案。

Method: 分析模型内部表示，提出激励早期层表示种族概念的干预方法。

Result: 对齐模型在早期层忽略种族概念，导致隐性偏见；新方法有效缓解偏见。

Conclusion: 忽略种族概念会加剧隐性偏见，激励早期层表示种族概念是有效的缓解策略。

Abstract: Although value-aligned language models (LMs) appear unbiased in explicit bias
evaluations, they often exhibit stereotypes in implicit word association tasks,
raising concerns about their fair usage. We investigate the mechanisms behind
this discrepancy and find that alignment surprisingly amplifies implicit bias
in model outputs. Specifically, we show that aligned LMs, unlike their
unaligned counterparts, overlook racial concepts in early internal
representations when the context is ambiguous. Not representing race likely
fails to activate safety guardrails, leading to unintended biases. Inspired by
this insight, we propose a new bias mitigation strategy that works by
incentivizing the representation of racial concepts in the early model layers.
In contrast to conventional mitigation methods of machine unlearning, our
interventions find that steering the model to be more aware of racial concepts
effectively mitigates implicit bias. Similar to race blindness in humans,
ignoring racial nuances can inadvertently perpetuate subtle biases in LMs.

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在招聘过程中倾向于选择未披露残疾信息的候选人，即使候选人资质相同，披露残疾信息会降低被选中的概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在招聘过程中对自愿披露残疾信息的候选人的偏见，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过比较相同资质但披露残疾信息与否的候选人在LLMs筛选中的表现。

Result: LLMs更倾向于选择未披露残疾信息的候选人，即使不披露也比披露者更受青睐。

Conclusion: LLMs在招聘中存在对残疾信息的潜在偏见，需进一步优化以确保公平性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into hiring
processes, concerns about fairness have gained prominence. When applying for
jobs, companies often request/require demographic information, including
gender, race, and disability or veteran status. This data is collected to
support diversity and inclusion initiatives, but when provided to LLMs,
especially disability-related information, it raises concerns about potential
biases in candidate selection outcomes. Many studies have highlighted how
disability can impact CV screening, yet little research has explored the
specific effect of voluntarily disclosed information on LLM-driven candidate
selection. This study seeks to bridge that gap. When candidates shared
identical gender, race, qualifications, experience, and backgrounds, and sought
jobs with minimal employment rate gaps between individuals with and without
disabilities (e.g., Cashier, Software Developer), LLMs consistently favored
candidates who disclosed that they had no disability. Even in cases where
candidates chose not to disclose their disability status, the LLMs were less
likely to select them compared to those who explicitly stated they did not have
a disability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了MultiHoax基准，用于评估大语言模型在复杂多步推理任务中处理错误前提的能力，发现现有模型在多国和多知识类别中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高风险领域部署时，其检测错误假设和批判性推理能力对确保可靠输出至关重要。现有基准仅关注单跳错误前提问题，而现实推理需要多步推理。

Method: 引入MultiHoax基准，覆盖七个国家和十个知识类别，利用维基百科作为知识源，评估模型在多步推理中的表现。

Result: 实验表明，现有大语言模型在不同国家、知识类别和多步推理类型中均难以检测错误前提。

Conclusion: 研究强调了大语言模型在错误前提检测和多步推理能力上的不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: As Large Language Models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains,
their ability to detect false assumptions and reason critically is crucial for
ensuring reliable outputs. False-premise questions (FPQs) serve as an important
evaluation method by exposing cases where flawed assumptions lead to incorrect
responses. While existing benchmarks focus on single-hop FPQs, real-world
reasoning often requires multi-hop inference, where models must verify
consistency across multiple reasoning steps rather than relying on
surface-level cues. To address this gap, we introduce MultiHoax, a benchmark
for evaluating LLMs' ability to handle false premises in complex, multi-step
reasoning tasks. Our dataset spans seven countries and ten diverse knowledge
categories, using Wikipedia as the primary knowledge source to enable factual
reasoning across regions. Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs
struggle to detect false premises across different countries, knowledge
categories, and multi-hop reasoning types, highlighting the need for improved
false premise detection and more robust multi-hop reasoning capabilities in
LLMs.

Abstract: The success of large language models has driven interest in developing
similar speech processing capabilities. However, a key challenge is the
scarcity of high-quality spontaneous speech data, as most existing datasets
contain scripted dialogues. To address this, we present a novel pipeline for
eliciting and recording natural dialogues and release our Stage 1 dataset with
200+ hours of spontaneous speech. Our approach fosters fluid, natural
conversations while encouraging a diverse range of topics and interactive
exchanges. Unlike traditional methods, it facilitates genuine interactions,
providing a reproducible framework for future data collection. This paper
introduces our dataset and methodology, laying the groundwork for addressing
the shortage of spontaneous speech data. We plan to expand this dataset in
future stages, offering a growing resource for the research community.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖、可扩展、可解释且多语言的层次化聚类方法，用于新闻和社交媒体数据，基于多语言Matryoshka嵌入和高效层次聚类算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在扩展性、透明性和多语言环境中的不足。

Method: 训练多语言Matryoshka嵌入模型，开发高效层次聚类算法。

Result: 嵌入模型在SemEval 2022 Task 8测试集上达到Pearson ρ=0.816的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别和聚类新闻数据中的故事、叙事和主题。

Abstract: Contextual large language model embeddings are increasingly utilized for
topic modeling and clustering. However, current methods often scale poorly,
rely on opaque similarity metrics, and struggle in multilingual settings. In
this work, we present a novel, scalable, interpretable, hierarchical, and
multilingual approach to clustering news articles and social media data. To do
this, we first train multilingual Matryoshka embeddings that can determine
story similarity at varying levels of granularity based on which subset of the
dimensions of the embeddings is examined. This embedding model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the SemEval 2022 Task 8 test dataset (Pearson
$\rho$ = 0.816). Once trained, we develop an efficient hierarchical clustering
algorithm that leverages the hierarchical nature of Matryoshka embeddings to
identify unique news stories, narratives, and themes. We conclude by
illustrating how our approach can identify and cluster stories, narratives, and
overarching themes within real-world news datasets.

*Ahmed Elhady,Eneko Agirre,Mikel Artetxe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在持续预训练（CPT）中加入英语数据虽不影响验证困惑度，但对目标语言下游任务能力至关重要。未加入英语会导致灾难性遗忘，影响模型泛化能力。提出课程学习和权重指数移动平均（EMA）作为替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨英语数据在CPT中对目标语言模型能力的影响，揭示其关键作用。

Method: 引入语言无关的上下文学习基准，分析英语数据的作用，并提出课程学习和EMA方法。

Result: 未加入英语数据会导致灾难性遗忘，影响模型泛化能力；课程学习和EMA可有效替代英语数据的作用。

Conclusion: 英语数据在CPT中对目标语言能力至关重要，课程学习和EMA是有效替代方案，为未来方法设计提供基础。

Abstract: Continued pretraining (CPT) is a popular approach to adapt existing large
language models (LLMs) to new languages. When doing so, it is common practice
to include a portion of English data in the mixture, but its role has not been
carefully studied to date. In this work, we show that including English does
not impact validation perplexity, yet it is critical for the emergence of
downstream capabilities in the target language. We introduce a
language-agnostic benchmark for in-context learning (ICL), which reveals
catastrophic forgetting early on CPT when English is not included. This in turn
damages the ability of the model to generalize to downstream prompts in the
target language as measured by perplexity, even if it does not manifest in
terms of accuracy until later in training, and can be tied to a big shift in
the model parameters. Based on these insights, we introduce curriculum learning
and exponential moving average (EMA) of weights as effective alternatives to
mitigate the need for English. All in all, our work sheds light into the
dynamics by which emergent abilities arise when doing CPT for language
adaptation, and can serve as a foundation to design more effective methods in
the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究是否可以通过分数对齐方法实现语言建模中的高效采样。

Method: 通过将学生模型的输出分数与预训练教师DLM的分数函数对齐，实现一步生成。

Result: 在DiffuSeq上实验显示，DLM-One实现了约500倍的推理加速，同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 一步扩散是高效高质量语言生成的有前景方向，适用于自然语言处理中的连续扩散模型。

Abstract: This paper introduces DLM-One, a score-distillation-based framework for
one-step sequence generation with continuous diffusion language models (DLMs).
DLM-One eliminates the need for iterative refinement by aligning the scores of
a student model's outputs in the continuous token embedding space with the
score function of a pretrained teacher DLM. We investigate whether DLM-One can
achieve substantial gains in sampling efficiency for language modeling. Through
comprehensive experiments on DiffuSeq -- a representative continuous DLM -- we
show that DLM-One achieves up to ~500x speedup in inference time while
maintaining competitive performance on benchmark text generation tasks used to
evaluate the teacher models. We further analyze the method's empirical behavior
across multiple datasets, providing initial insights into its generality and
practical applicability. Our findings position one-step diffusion as a
promising direction for efficient, high-quality language generation and broader
adoption of continuous diffusion models operating in embedding space for
natural language processing.

*Payal Mohapatra,Akash Pandey,Xiaoyuan Zhang,Qi Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型EMG适配器模块，将无声EMG特征映射到大型语言模型（LLM）的输入空间，显著提升了无声EMG到文本的转换性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无声EMG是失声人群的重要沟通工具，但现有方法依赖有声和无声EMG的配对数据，不实用。本文探索LLM在无声语音理解中的潜力。

Method: 提出EMG适配器模块，将无声EMG特征映射到LLM输入空间，仅需少量数据即可训练。

Result: 在封闭词汇任务中达到0.49的平均词错误率（WER），数据仅需6分钟时性能提升近20%。

Conclusion: 本研究为LLM理解无声EMG信号迈出了重要一步，展示了其在无声语音识别中的潜力。

Abstract: Unvoiced electromyography (EMG) is an effective communication tool for
individuals unable to produce vocal speech. However, most prior methods rely on
paired voiced and unvoiced EMG signals, along with speech data, for EMG-to-text
conversion, which is not practical for such individuals. Given the rise of
large language models (LLMs) in speech recognition, we explore their potential
to understand unvoiced speech. To this end, we address the challenge of
learning from unvoiced EMG alone and propose a novel EMG adaptor module that
maps EMG features into an LLM's input space, achieving an average word error
rate (WER) of 0.49 on a closed-vocabulary unvoiced EMG-to-text task. Even with
a conservative data availability of just six minutes, our approach improves
performance over specialized models by nearly 20%. While LLMs have been shown
to be extendable to new language modalities -- such as audio -- understanding
articulatory biosignals like unvoiced EMG remains more challenging. This work
takes a crucial first step toward enabling LLMs to comprehend unvoiced speech
using surface EMG.

*John Harvill,Ziwei Fan,Hao Wang,Yizhou Sun,Hao Ding,Luke Huan,Anoop Deoras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种任务无关的无损压缩技术，用于减少LLM的输入令牌序列长度，平均减少27%和18%，同时保留所有语义信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多采用有损压缩，专注于保留与下游任务相关的语义信息，但可能丢失其他信息。本文旨在开发一种无损压缩技术，确保语义完整性。

Method: 采用类似LZ77的无损压缩技术，对输入令牌序列进行压缩，减少序列长度，同时确保可逆性。

Result: 在两个评估任务中，输入令牌序列长度平均减少27%和18%，编码计算量分别减少47%和33%。无损压缩在严格语义保留任务中表现优于有损方法。

Conclusion: 无损压缩技术性能接近未压缩输入，且更大模型和计算资源可能完全消除性能差距。

Abstract: Existing work on prompt compression for Large Language Models (LLM) focuses
on lossy methods that try to maximize the retention of semantic information
that is relevant to downstream tasks while significantly reducing the sequence
length. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic lossless compression
technique similar to LZ77 that makes it possible to reduce the input token
sequence length on average by 27\% and 18\% for the two evaluation tasks
explored here. Given that we use transformer-based LLMs, this equates to 47\%
and 33\% less encoding computation, respectively, due to the quadratic nature
of attention. The token sequence transformation is trivial to reverse and
highlights that no semantic information is lost in the process. We evaluate our
proposed approach on two tasks that require strict preservation of
semantics/syntax and demonstrate that existing lossy compression methods
perform poorly in this setting. We find that our lossless compression technique
produces only a small gap in performance compared to using the uncompressed
input and posit that larger models and an expanded computing budget would
likely erase the gap entirely.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于GPT-4o、DeepSeek-V3和Gemini-2.0三种大语言模型（LLMs）的电影评论生成框架，并通过与IMDb用户评论的比较评估其性能。结果表明，LLMs能生成语法流畅、结构完整的评论，但在情感丰富性和风格一致性上与人类评论仍有差距。DeepSeek-V3表现最平衡，GPT-4o偏向积极情感，Gemini-2.0则更擅长负面情感但情感强度过高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在电影评论生成任务中的适用性，并评估其生成评论的质量。

Method: 使用电影字幕和剧本作为输入，通过三种LLMs生成评论，并从词汇、情感极性、相似性和主题一致性等方面与IMDb用户评论进行比较。

Result: LLMs能生成语法流畅的评论，但在情感丰富性和风格一致性上不如人类评论。DeepSeek-V3表现最接近人类评论，GPT-4o偏向积极情感，Gemini-2.0更擅长负面情感但情感强度过高。

Conclusion: LLMs在电影评论生成任务中表现出潜力，但仍需进一步优化以提升情感丰富性和风格一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been prominent in various tasks, including
text generation and summarisation. The applicability of LLMs to the generation
of product reviews is gaining momentum, paving the way for the generation of
movie reviews. In this study, we propose a framework that generates movie
reviews using three LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini-2.0), and evaluate
their performance by comparing the generated outputs with IMDb user reviews. We
use movie subtitles and screenplays as input to the LLMs and investigate how
they affect the quality of reviews generated. We review the LLM-based movie
reviews in terms of vocabulary, sentiment polarity, similarity, and thematic
consistency in comparison to IMDB user reviews. The results demonstrate that
LLMs are capable of generating syntactically fluent and structurally complete
movie reviews. Nevertheless, there is still a noticeable gap in emotional
richness and stylistic coherence between LLM-generated and IMDb reviews,
suggesting that further refinement is needed to improve the overall quality of
movie review generation. We provided a survey-based analysis where participants
were told to distinguish between LLM and IMDb user reviews. The results show
that LLM-generated reviews are difficult to distinguish from IMDB user reviews.
We found that DeepSeek-V3 produced the most balanced reviews, closely matching
IMDb reviews. GPT-4o overemphasised positive emotions, while Gemini-2.0
captured negative emotions better but showed excessive emotional intensity.

Motivation: 随着语言模型处理复杂任务的能力提升，需要更精细的评估方法以理解其具体能力，从而指导模型开发。

Method: 利用LLM作为评判者，SkillVerse首先分析模型响应，然后将其组织为树状结构（dendrogram），支持多粒度能力评估。

Result: SkillVerse在两项任务中表现优异：1）通过树搜索算法提升模型上下文学习能力25%；2）预测模型弱点的成功率提高22%。

Conclusion: SkillVerse提供了一种灵活且有效的方法，用于深入分析语言模型的能力，并支持模型优化。

Abstract: As language models evolve to tackle complex, multifaceted tasks, their
evaluation must adapt to capture this intricacy. A granular, skill-specific
understanding of model capabilities can empower researchers to make informed
model development plans. In this paper, we introduce SkillVerse, an
unsupervised tree-structured diagnosis framework for understanding model
proficiency in specific abilities. With LLM as a judge, SkillVerse first
critiques the model responses, and then organizes them into a hierarchical
structure termed dendrogram. Given proficiency at arbitrary levels of
granularity, SkillVerse is flexible to produce insights of behaviors of modern
large models. We also demonstrate its efficacy in two downstream tasks: 1)
improving model in-context learning by 25% using a tree-search algorithm to
select more informative few-shot demonstrations, and 2) accurately predicting
new model weaknesses with a 55% success rate, 22% higher than without
SkillVerse.

TL;DR: TreeRare是一种基于语法树的信息检索和推理框架，用于解决复杂、知识密集型问题，通过局部化查询和证据合成显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有检索框架中因推理错误和检索结果不匹配导致的性能限制。

Method: 利用语法树自底向上遍历，生成子组件查询并检索相关段落，合成局部证据后聚合为最终答案。

Result: 在五个问答数据集上，TreeRare显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: TreeRare通过语法树引导的检索和推理，有效解决了复杂问题中的不确定性，提升了问答性能。

Abstract: In real practice, questions are typically complex and knowledge-intensive,
requiring Large Language Models (LLMs) to recognize the multifaceted nature of
the question and reason across multiple information sources. Iterative and
adaptive retrieval, where LLMs decide when and what to retrieve based on their
reasoning, has been shown to be a promising approach to resolve complex,
knowledge-intensive questions. However, the performance of such retrieval
frameworks is limited by the accumulation of reasoning errors and misaligned
retrieval results. To overcome these limitations, we propose TreeRare (Syntax
Tree-Guided Retrieval and Reasoning), a framework that utilizes syntax trees to
guide information retrieval and reasoning for question answering. Following the
principle of compositionality, TreeRare traverses the syntax tree in a
bottom-up fashion, and in each node, it generates subcomponent-based queries
and retrieves relevant passages to resolve localized uncertainty. A
subcomponent question answering module then synthesizes these passages into
concise, context-aware evidence. Finally, TreeRare aggregates the evidence
across the tree to form a final answer. Experiments across five question
answering datasets involving ambiguous or multi-hop reasoning demonstrate that
TreeRare achieves substantial improvements over existing state-of-the-art
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言混合现象在社交媒体等非正式交流中普遍存在，但缺乏公开的、标注的语料库用于研究。

Method: 通过持续收集、验证和整合多语言混合消息，构建结构化数据集（JSON格式），并提供详细元数据和语言统计。

Result: 目前语料库包含超过355,641条消息，涵盖多种语言混合模式，主要关注英语和普通话。

Conclusion: 该语料库有望成为计算语言学、社会语言学和NLP应用的基础数据集。

Abstract: Code-mixing involves the seamless integration of linguistic elements from
multiple languages within a single discourse, reflecting natural multilingual
communication patterns. Despite its prominence in informal interactions such as
social media, chat messages and instant-messaging exchanges, there has been a
lack of publicly available corpora that are author-labeled and suitable for
modeling human conversations and relationships. This study introduces the first
labeled and general-purpose corpus for understanding code-mixing in context
while maintaining rigorous privacy and ethical standards. Our live project will
continuously gather, verify, and integrate code-mixed messages into a
structured dataset released in JSON format, accompanied by detailed metadata
and linguistic statistics. To date, it includes over 355,641 messages spanning
various code-mixing patterns, with a primary focus on English, Mandarin, and
other languages. We expect the Codemix Corpus to serve as a foundational
dataset for research in computational linguistics, sociolinguistics, and NLP
applications.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了语言模型在情感推理中的表现，指出其能进行一定程度的情境推理，但在关联情境结果与特定情感方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索语言模型如何利用上下文信息推理他人情感状态，超越表面特征，结合心理理论框架。

Method: 基于认知评估理论，构建了一个专门的心理理论评估数据集，评估模型从前向（情境到情感）和后向（情感到情境）的推理能力。

Result: 结果显示，语言模型能进行一定程度的情感推理，但在关联情境结果与特定情感方面表现较差。

Conclusion: 结论强调了在语言模型的情感推理训练和评估中融入心理学理论的必要性。

Abstract: Datasets used for emotion recognition tasks typically contain overt cues that
can be used in predicting the emotions expressed in a text. However, one
challenge is that texts sometimes contain covert contextual cues that are rich
in affective semantics, which warrant higher-order reasoning abilities to infer
emotional states, not simply the emotions conveyed. This study advances beyond
surface-level perceptual features to investigate how large language models
(LLMs) reason about others' emotional states using contextual information,
within a Theory-of-Mind (ToM) framework. Grounded in Cognitive Appraisal
Theory, we curate a specialized ToM evaluation dataset1 to assess both forward
reasoning - from context to emotion- and backward reasoning - from emotion to
inferred context. We showed that LLMs can reason to a certain extent, although
they are poor at associating situational outcomes and appraisals with specific
emotions. Our work highlights the need for psychological theories in the
training and evaluation of LLMs in the context of emotion reasoning.

Motivation: 解决OWSM项目训练数据不足的问题，并处理YODAS数据集的噪声问题。

Method: 开发可扩展的数据清理流程，整合YODAS数据集，训练新的OWSM v4模型。

Result: 新模型在多语言基准测试中显著优于前代，部分场景下超越Whisper和MMS。

Conclusion: 公开清理后的YODAS数据、预训练模型及相关脚本，推动开源语音模型发展。

Abstract: The Open Whisper-style Speech Models (OWSM) project has developed a series of
fully open speech foundation models using academic-scale resources, but their
training data remains insufficient. This work enhances OWSM by integrating
YODAS, a large-scale web-crawled dataset with a Creative Commons license.
However, incorporating YODAS is nontrivial due to its wild nature, which
introduces challenges such as incorrect language labels and audio-text
misalignments. To address this, we develop a scalable data-cleaning pipeline
using public toolkits, yielding a dataset with 166,000 hours of speech across
75 languages. Our new series of OWSM v4 models, trained on this curated dataset
alongside existing OWSM data, significantly outperform previous versions on
multilingual benchmarks. Our models even match or surpass frontier industrial
models like Whisper and MMS in multiple scenarios. We will publicly release the
cleaned YODAS data, pre-trained models, and all associated scripts via the
ESPnet toolkit.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部模型进行语义聚类，导致计算开销大且难以捕捉上下文语义。

Method: 提出LSC方法，利用生成LLM的内部隐藏状态进行语义聚类。

Result: 实验表明，LSC在保持或超越现有方法性能的同时，显著提高了计算效率。

Conclusion: LSC是一种高效且上下文敏感的语义聚类方法，适用于LLM的测试时扩展。

Abstract: Scaling test-time computation--generating and analyzing multiple or
sequential outputs for a single input--has become a promising strategy for
improving the reliability and quality of large language models (LLMs), as
evidenced by advances in uncertainty quantification and multi-step reasoning. A
key shared component is semantic clustering, which groups outputs that differ
in form but convey the same meaning. Semantic clustering enables estimation of
the distribution over the semantics of outputs and helps avoid redundant
exploration of reasoning paths. However, existing approaches typically rely on
external models, which introduce substantial computational overhead and often
fail to capture context-aware semantics. We propose Latent Semantic Clustering
(LSC), a lightweight and context-sensitive method that leverages the generator
LLM's internal hidden states for clustering, eliminating the need for external
models. Our extensive experiment across various LLMs and datasets shows that
LSC significantly improves the computational efficiency of test-time scaling
while maintaining or exceeding the performance of existing methods.

Result: 在低数据量（30分钟）下表现优异，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: Neuro2Semantic展示了在脑机接口中的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Decoding continuous language from neural signals remains a significant
challenge in the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. We
introduce Neuro2Semantic, a novel framework that reconstructs the semantic
content of perceived speech from intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. Our
approach consists of two phases: first, an LSTM-based adapter aligns neural
signals with pre-trained text embeddings; second, a corrector module generates
continuous, natural text directly from these aligned embeddings. This flexible
method overcomes the limitations of previous decoding approaches and enables
unconstrained text generation. Neuro2Semantic achieves strong performance with
as little as 30 minutes of neural data, outperforming a recent state-of-the-art
method in low-data settings. These results highlight the potential for
practical applications in brain-computer interfaces and neural decoding
technologies.

Motivation: 标准化患者模拟成本高且不灵活，现有虚拟患者系统缺乏对学员沟通技能的动态适应能力。

Method: 开发Adaptive-VP框架，结合临床场景构建和实时评估模块，动态调整虚拟患者行为。

Result: 自动化评估显示框架能反映实际沟通能力，专家确认其交互更自然真实。

Conclusion: Adaptive-VP是一种可扩展且有效的护理沟通培训工具。

Abstract: Effective communication training is essential to preparing nurses for
high-quality patient care. While standardized patient (SP) simulations provide
valuable experiential learning, they are often costly and inflexible. Virtual
patient (VP) systems offer a scalable alternative, but most fail to adapt to
the varying communication skills of trainees. In particular, when trainees
respond ineffectively, VPs should escalate in hostility or become
uncooperative--yet this level of adaptive interaction remains largely
unsupported. To address this gap, we introduce Adaptive-VP, a VP dialogue
generation framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to dynamically
adapt VP behavior based on trainee input. The framework features a pipeline for
constructing clinically grounded yet flexible VP scenarios and a modular system
for assessing trainee communication and adjusting VP responses in real time,
while ensuring learner safety. We validated Adaptive-VP by simulating
challenging patient conversations. Automated evaluation using a corpus from
practicing nurses showed that our communication skill evaluation mechanism
reflected real-world proficiency levels. Expert nurses further confirmed that
Adaptive-VP produced more natural and realistic interactions than existing
approaches, demonstrating its potential as a scalable and effective tool for
nursing communication training.

TL;DR: SHARE是一种基于SLM的分层动作校正助手，通过将声明式SQL查询转换为逐步动作轨迹，并利用两阶段细化，解决了传统自校正方法计算开销大和错误检测能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自校正方法存在计算开销大和LLMs对SQL查询的错误检测能力不足的问题，需要更高效和精确的解决方案。

Method: SHARE采用三个专用SLM的序列化流程，将SQL查询转换为动作轨迹，并进行两阶段细化，同时提出分层自进化策略进行数据高效训练。

Result: 实验表明，SHARE显著提升了自校正能力，并在低资源训练场景下保持强健性能。

Conclusion: SHARE为文本到SQL应用提供了一种高效、精确且数据隐私友好的自校正解决方案。

Abstract: Current self-correction approaches in text-to-SQL face two critical
limitations: 1) Conventional self-correction methods rely on recursive
self-calls of LLMs, resulting in multiplicative computational overhead, and 2)
LLMs struggle to implement effective error detection and correction for
declarative SQL queries, as they fail to demonstrate the underlying reasoning
path. In this work, we propose SHARE, an SLM-based Hierarchical Action
corREction assistant that enables LLMs to perform more precise error
localization and efficient correction. SHARE orchestrates three specialized
Small Language Models (SLMs) in a sequential pipeline, where it first
transforms declarative SQL queries into stepwise action trajectories that
reveal underlying reasoning, followed by a two-phase granular refinement. We
further propose a novel hierarchical self-evolution strategy for data-efficient
training. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARE effectively enhances
self-correction capabilities while proving robust across various LLMs.
Furthermore, our comprehensive analysis shows that SHARE maintains strong
performance even in low-resource training settings, which is particularly
valuable for text-to-SQL applications with data privacy constraints.

Motivation: 现有方法在LLM决策中往往忽视效率与性能的平衡，导致高成本。

Method: 引入3E标准评估搜索策略，提出SRM框架，结合外部奖励分配器和推测验证机制。

Result: 实验表明SRM将成本降至原框架的1/10，同时保持效果。

Conclusion: SRM为LLM决策提供了一种高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective decision-making in Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for
handling intricate tasks. However, existing approaches prioritize performance
but often overlook the balance between effectiveness and computational cost. To
address this, we first introduce the 3E Criteria to systematically assess the
cost-effectiveness of search strategies, revealing that existing methods often
trade significant efficiency for marginal performance gains. To improve LLM
decision-making while maintaining efficiency, we propose the Speculative Reward
Model (SRM), a plug-and-play framework that seamlessly integrates with existing
search strategies. Specifically, SRM employs an external reward assigner to
predict optimal actions, reducing reliance on LLMs' internal self-evaluation.
And a speculative verification mechanism is used to prune suboptimal choices
and guide the search toward more promising steps. We evaluate SRM on several
complex decision-making tasks including mathematical reasoning, planning and
numerical reasoning in specialized domains. Experimental results show that SRM
reduces costs to 1/10 of the original search framework on average while
maintaining effectiveness.

TL;DR: 论文研究了文本提示优化在大型语言模型中的重要性，提出了一种新的方法TSGD-M，通过重加权采样提高性能并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着提示在大型语言模型中的作用日益关键，优化文本提示成为一个重要挑战。现有方法TGD在数据规模增加时性能下降且计算成本高。

Method: 受数值梯度下降启发，提出TSGD-M方法，通过基于过去批次分布的重加权采样，实现可扩展的上下文学习。

Result: 在九个NLP任务中，TSGD-M显著优于未采用重加权采样的TGD基线，同时降低了大多数任务的方差。

Conclusion: TSGD-M是一种高效且可扩展的文本提示优化方法，适用于多种NLP任务。

Abstract: As prompts play an increasingly critical role in large language models
(LLMs), optimizing textual prompts has become a crucial challenge. The Textual
Gradient Descent (TGD) framework has emerged as a promising data-driven
approach that iteratively refines textual prompts using LLM - suggested updates
(or textual gradients) over minibatches of training samples. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that scaling the number of training examples initially
improves but later degrades TGD's performance across multiple downstream NLP
tasks. However, while data scaling improves results for most tasks, it also
significantly increases the computational cost when leveraging LLMs. To address
this, we draw inspiration from numerical gradient descent and propose Textual
Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (TSGD-M) - a method that facilitates
scalable in-context learning by reweighting prompt sampling based on past batch
distributions. Across nine NLP tasks spanning three domains - including
BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), natural language understanding tasks, and reasoning tasks
- TSGD-M significantly outperforms TGD baselines that do not incorporate
reweighted sampling, while also reducing variance in most tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种因果结构发现方法，用于分析儿童自动语音识别（ASR）表现不佳的多种因素及其相互依赖关系，并通过因果量化测量各因素的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童ASR表现常不如成人，现有方法孤立分析因素，忽略其相互依赖关系。

Method: 引入因果结构发现和因果量化方法，分析生理、认知和外部因素对ASR的影响，并扩展到微调模型。

Result: 实验证明该方法在不同ASR系统（Whisper和Wav2Vec2.0）中具有普适性。

Conclusion: 揭示了儿童ASR表现不佳的复杂因素及其相互关系，为改进ASR系统提供了新视角。

Abstract: Children's automatic speech recognition (ASR) often underperforms compared to
that of adults due to a confluence of interdependent factors: physiological
(e.g., smaller vocal tracts), cognitive (e.g., underdeveloped pronunciation),
and extrinsic (e.g., vocabulary limitations, background noise). Existing
analysis methods examine the impact of these factors in isolation, neglecting
interdependencies-such as age affecting ASR accuracy both directly and
indirectly via pronunciation skills. In this paper, we introduce a causal
structure discovery to unravel these interdependent relationships among
physiology, cognition, extrinsic factors, and ASR errors. Then, we employ
causal quantification to measure each factor's impact on children's ASR. We
extend the analysis to fine-tuned models to identify which factors are
mitigated by fine-tuning and which remain largely unaffected. Experiments on
Whisper and Wav2Vec2.0 demonstrate the generalizability of our findings across
different ASR systems.

TL;DR: APD是一种动态调整并行生成令牌数量的新方法，通过结合dLLM和辅助自回归模型的概率，显著提高了生成速度且质量损失极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归解码速度慢的问题，同时避免扩散模型在并行生成时的质量损失。

Method: 引入自适应并行解码（APD），结合dLLM和辅助自回归模型的概率，优化KV缓存和掩码输入大小。

Result: APD在下游基准测试中显著提高了吞吐量，且质量损失极小。

Conclusion: APD通过动态调整并行生成令牌数量，实现了速度与质量的灵活权衡。

Abstract: The generation speed of LLMs are bottlenecked by autoregressive decoding,
where tokens are predicted sequentially one by one. Alternatively, diffusion
large language models (dLLMs) theoretically allow for parallel token
generation, but in practice struggle to achieve the speed of autoregressive
models without significantly sacrificing quality. We therefore introduce
adaptive parallel decoding (APD), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the
number of tokens sampled in parallel. We achieve this by defining a
multiplicative mixture between the dLLM marginal probabilities and the joint
probability of sequences under a small auxiliary autoregressive model. This
inverts the standard setup of speculative decoding, where the goal is to sample
from a large autoregressive verifier by drafting from a smaller model. We
further optimize APD by enabling KV caching and limiting the size of the masked
input. Altogether, our method puts forward three tunable parameters to flexibly
tradeoff throughput and quality. We show that APD provides markedly higher
throughput with minimal quality degradations on downstream benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于困惑度的方法在高噪声比例下失效，因为噪声样本的困惑度可能与干净样本相似。论文旨在解决这一局限性。

Method: 引入双去偏框架，利用合成邻居校正困惑度估计，生成鲁棒的样本清洁度评分（Sample Cleanliness Score）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在噪声检测能力上优于现有方法，且最终ICL性能接近完全干净的演示语料库。

Conclusion: 该方法在高噪声比例下仍保持鲁棒性，为基于困惑度的文本生成提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: In context learning (ICL) relies heavily on high quality demonstrations drawn
from large annotated corpora. Existing approaches detect noisy annotations by
ranking local perplexities, presuming that noisy samples yield higher
perplexities than their clean counterparts. However, this assumption breaks
down when the noise ratio is high and many demonstrations are flawed. We
reexamine the perplexity based paradigm for text generation under noisy
annotations, highlighting two sources of bias in perplexity: the annotation
itself and the domain specific knowledge inherent in large language models
(LLMs). To overcome these biases, we introduce a dual debiasing framework that
uses synthesized neighbors to explicitly correct perplexity estimates, yielding
a robust Sample Cleanliness Score. This metric uncovers absolute sample
cleanliness regardless of the overall corpus noise level. Extensive experiments
demonstrate our method's superior noise detection capabilities and show that
its final ICL performance is comparable to that of a fully clean demonstration
corpus. Moreover, our approach remains robust even when noise ratios are
extremely high.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注图像任务，忽视听觉信息，且对话多为静态讨论而非自然融入。多模态在多会话和多参与者场景中的整合也受限于任务特定约束。

Method: 引入$M^3C$数据集，提出多模态记忆检索模型，支持视觉和听觉输入的自然处理。

Result: 模型在复杂场景中能长期连贯对话，人类评估显示其动态交互能力优异。

Conclusion: 该模型为高级多模态对话代理提供了潜力，推动了更沉浸式人机交互的发展。

Abstract: As chatbots continue to evolve toward human-like, real-world, interactions,
multimodality remains an active area of research and exploration. So far,
efforts to integrate multimodality into chatbots have primarily focused on
image-centric tasks, such as visual dialogue and image-based instructions,
placing emphasis on the "eyes" of human perception while neglecting the "ears",
namely auditory aspects. Moreover, these studies often center around static
interactions that focus on discussing the modality rather than naturally
incorporating it into the conversation, which limits the richness of
simultaneous, dynamic engagement. Furthermore, while multimodality has been
explored in multi-party and multi-session conversations, task-specific
constraints have hindered its seamless integration into dynamic, natural
conversations. To address these challenges, this study aims to equip chatbots
with "eyes and ears" capable of more immersive interactions with humans. As
part of this effort, we introduce a new multimodal conversation dataset,
Multimodal Multi-Session Multi-Party Conversation ($M^3C$), and propose a novel
multimodal conversation model featuring multimodal memory retrieval. Our model,
trained on the $M^3C$, demonstrates the ability to seamlessly engage in
long-term conversations with multiple speakers in complex, real-world-like
settings, effectively processing visual and auditory inputs to understand and
respond appropriately. Human evaluations highlight the model's strong
performance in maintaining coherent and dynamic interactions, demonstrating its
potential for advanced multimodal conversational agents.

Motivation: 解决动态词汇在非自回归模型中因条件独立性假设而无法捕捉静态与动态词汇依赖关系的问题。

Method: 提出DYNAC方法，通过自条件CTC将动态词汇整合到中间层，优化编码器对动态词汇的依赖关系。

Result: 在LibriSpeech 960测试集上，DYNAC将实时因子降低81%，词错误率仅增加0.1个百分点。

Conclusion: DYNAC在保持高准确率的同时显著提升了推理速度，为非自回归模型的上下文偏置提供了一种有效方法。

Abstract: Contextual biasing (CB) improves automatic speech recognition for rare and
unseen phrases. Recent studies have introduced dynamic vocabulary, which
represents context phrases as expandable tokens in autoregressive (AR) models.
This method improves CB accuracy but with slow inference speed. While dynamic
vocabulary can be applied to non-autoregressive (NAR) models, such as
connectionist temporal classification (CTC), the conditional independence
assumption fails to capture dependencies between static and dynamic tokens.
This paper proposes DYNAC (Dynamic Vocabulary-based NAR Contextualization), a
self-conditioned CTC method that integrates dynamic vocabulary into
intermediate layers. Conditioning the encoder on dynamic vocabulary, DYNAC
effectively captures dependencies between static and dynamic tokens while
reducing the real-time factor (RTF). Experimental results show that DYNAC
reduces RTF by 81% with a 0.1-point degradation in word error rate on the
LibriSpeech 960 test-clean set.

Conclusion: RI$^2$VER框架在多证据合成问题上表现优异，验证了其跨段落验证流程的有效性。

Abstract: Multi-answer question answering (QA), where questions can have many valid
answers, presents a significant challenge for existing retrieval-augmented
generation-based QA systems, as these systems struggle to retrieve and then
synthesize a large number of evidence passages. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a new multi-answer QA framework -- Retrieval-augmented Independent
Reading with Inter-passage Verification (RI$^2$VER). Our framework retrieves a
large set of passages and processes each passage individually to generate an
initial high-recall but noisy answer set. Then we propose a new inter-passage
verification pipeline that validates every candidate answer through (1)
Verification Question Generation, (2) Gathering Additional Evidence, and (3)
Verification with inter-passage synthesis. Evaluations on the QAMPARI and RoMQA
datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing
baselines across various model sizes, achieving an average F1 score improvement
of 11.17%. Further analysis validates that our inter-passage verification
pipeline enables our framework to be particularly beneficial for questions
requiring multi-evidence synthesis.

Motivation: 现有方法在TKG预测任务中同时学习通用模式和场景信息，导致两者相互干扰，影响模型的泛化能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，G2S显著提升了LLMs的泛化能力。

Conclusion: G2S框架通过分离通用和特定知识的学习过程，有效增强了模型在TKG预测任务中的性能。

Abstract: Forecasting over Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) which predicts future facts
based on historical ones has received much attention. Recent studies have
introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task to enhance the models'
generalization abilities. However, these models perform forecasting via
simultaneously learning two kinds of entangled knowledge in the TKG: (1)
general patterns, i.e., invariant temporal structures shared across different
scenarios; and (2) scenario information, i.e., factual knowledge engaged in
specific scenario, such as entities and relations. As a result, the learning
processes of these two kinds of knowledge may interfere with each other, which
potentially impact the generalization abilities of the models. To enhance the
generalization ability of LLMs on this task, in this paper, we propose a
General-to-Specific learning framework (G2S) that disentangles the learning
processes of the above two kinds of knowledge. In the general learning stage,
we mask the scenario information in different TKGs and convert it into
anonymous temporal structures. After training on these structures, the model is
able to capture the general patterns across different TKGs. In the specific
learning stage, we inject the scenario information into the structures via
either in-context learning or fine-tuning modes. Experimental results show that
G2S effectively improves the generalization abilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) during summarization of
patient-clinician dialogues pose significant risks to patient care and clinical
decision-making. However, the phenomenon remains understudied in the clinical
domain, with uncertainty surrounding the applicability of general-domain
hallucination detectors. The rarity and randomness of hallucinations further
complicate their investigation. In this paper, we conduct an evaluation of
hallucination detection methods in the medical domain, and construct two
datasets for the purpose: A fact-controlled Leave-N-out dataset -- generated by
systematically removing facts from source dialogues to induce hallucinated
content in summaries; and a natural hallucination dataset -- arising
organically during LLM-based medical summarization. We show that general-domain
detectors struggle to detect clinical hallucinations, and that performance on
fact-controlled hallucinations does not reliably predict effectiveness on
natural hallucinations. We then develop fact-based approaches that count
hallucinations, offering explainability not available with existing methods.
Notably, our LLM-based detectors, which we developed using fact-controlled
hallucinations, generalize well to detecting real-world clinical
hallucinations. This research contributes a suite of specialized metrics
supported by expert-annotated datasets to advance faithful clinical
summarization systems.

Abstract: Visual persuasion, which uses visual elements to influence cognition and
behaviors, is crucial in fields such as advertising and political
communication. With recent advancements in artificial intelligence, there is
growing potential to develop persuasive systems that automatically generate
persuasive images tailored to individuals. However, a significant bottleneck in
this area is the lack of comprehensive datasets that connect the persuasiveness
of images with the personal information about those who evaluated the images.
To address this gap and facilitate technological advancements in personalized
visual persuasion, we release the Personalized Visual Persuasion (PVP) dataset,
comprising 28,454 persuasive images across 596 messages and 9 persuasion
strategies. Importantly, the PVP dataset provides persuasiveness scores of
images evaluated by 2,521 human annotators, along with their demographic and
psychological characteristics (personality traits and values). We demonstrate
the utility of our dataset by developing a persuasive image generator and an
automated evaluator, and establish benchmark baselines. Our experiments reveal
that incorporating psychological characteristics enhances the generation and
evaluation of persuasive images, providing valuable insights for personalized
visual persuasion.

Conclusion: 结合LLM与标签传播技术可显著提升假新闻检测性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist multimodal fake news detection by
predicting pseudo labels. However, LLM-generated pseudo labels alone
demonstrate poor performance compared to traditional detection methods, making
their effective integration non-trivial. In this paper, we propose Global Label
Propagation Network with LLM-based Pseudo Labeling (GLPN-LLM) for multimodal
fake news detection, which integrates LLM capabilities via label propagation
techniques. The global label propagation can utilize LLM-generated pseudo
labels, enhancing prediction accuracy by propagating label information among
all samples. For label propagation, a mask-based mechanism is designed to
prevent label leakage during training by ensuring that training nodes do not
propagate their own labels back to themselves. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets show that by synergizing LLMs with label propagation, our
model achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across
various tasks, leveraging their exceptional in-context learning ability with
only a few examples. Accordingly, the selection of optimal in-context examples
has been actively studied in the field of machine translation. However, these
studies presuppose the presence of a demonstration pool with human-annotated
pairs, making them less applicable to low-resource languages where such an
assumption is challenging to meet. To overcome this limitation, this paper
explores the research direction of in-context example generation for machine
translation. Specifically, we propose Demonstration Augmentation for
Translation (DAT), a simple yet effective approach that generates example pairs
without relying on any external resources. This method builds upon two prior
criteria, relevance and diversity, which have been highlighted in previous work
as key factors for in-context example selection. Through experiments and
analysis on low-resource languages where human-annotated pairs are scarce, we
show that DAT achieves superior translation quality compared to the baselines.
Furthermore, we investigate the potential of progressively accumulating
generated pairs during test time to build and reuse a demonstration pool. Our
implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/aiclaudev/DAT.

misinformation injection. To facilitate a deeper understanding of
misinformation propagation dynamics within these systems, we introduce
MisinfoTask, a novel dataset featuring complex, realistic tasks designed to
evaluate MAS robustness against such threats. Building upon this, we propose
ARGUS, a two-stage, training-free defense framework leveraging goal-aware
reasoning for precise misinformation rectification within information flows.
Our experiments demonstrate that in challenging misinformation scenarios, ARGUS
exhibits significant efficacy across various injection attacks, achieving an
average reduction in misinformation toxicity of approximately 28.17% and
improving task success rates under attack by approximately 10.33%. Our code and
dataset is available at: https://github.com/zhrli324/ARGUS.

### [62] [Evaluating the Evaluation of Diversity in Commonsense Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00514)
*Tianhui Zhang,Bei Peng,Danushka Bollegala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了常识生成任务中多样性评估指标的适用性，发现基于内容的指标优于基于形式的指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标在衡量常识生成多样性时表现不一，缺乏明确的最佳选择。

Method: 通过系统元评估和LLM标注的新数据集，比较形式与内容多样性指标。

Result: 基于内容的指标与LLM评分高度相关，优于形式指标。

Conclusion: 建议未来常识生成研究采用基于内容的多样性评估指标。

Abstract: In commonsense generation, given a set of input concepts, a model must
generate a response that is not only commonsense bearing, but also capturing
multiple diverse viewpoints. Numerous evaluation metrics based on form- and
content-level overlap have been proposed in prior work for evaluating the
diversity of a commonsense generation model. However, it remains unclear as to
which metrics are best suited for evaluating the diversity in commonsense
generation. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic meta-evaluation of
diversity metrics for commonsense generation. We find that form-based diversity
metrics tend to consistently overestimate the diversity in sentence sets, where
even randomly generated sentences are assigned overly high diversity scores. We
then use an Large Language Model (LLM) to create a novel dataset annotated for
the diversity of sentences generated for a commonsense generation task, and use
it to conduct a meta-evaluation of the existing diversity evaluation metrics.
Our experimental results show that content-based diversity evaluation metrics
consistently outperform the form-based counterparts, showing high correlations
with the LLM-based ratings. We recommend that future work on commonsense
generation should use content-based metrics for evaluating the diversity of
their outputs.

*Yuxi Sun,Aoqi Zuo,Wei Gao,Jing Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CausalAbstain的方法，通过因果视角帮助LLMs在多语言场景中决定是否使用生成的反馈，并选择最有用的反馈，以减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在多语言环境中因知识差异导致的幻觉问题，现有方法依赖生成的反馈但易受不准确性和偏见影响。

Method: 提出CausalAbstain方法，从因果视角分析并选择最有用的反馈，增强LLMs的弃权决策。

Result: 在两种基准数据集（百科和常识QA任务）上，CausalAbstain在原生语言和多语言设置中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CausalAbstain能有效选择反馈并提升弃权决策的准确性和可解释性，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit knowledge disparities across
languages. Encouraging LLMs to \textit{abstain} when faced with knowledge gaps
is a promising strategy to reduce hallucinations in multilingual settings.
Current abstention strategies for multilingual scenarios primarily rely on
generating feedback in various languages using LLMs and performing
self-reflection. However, these methods can be adversely impacted by
inaccuracies and biases in the generated feedback. To address this, from a
causal perspective, we introduce \textit{CausalAbstain}, a method that helps
LLMs determine whether to utilize multiple generated feedback responses and how
to identify the most useful ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textit{CausalAbstain} effectively selects helpful feedback and enhances
abstention decisions with interpretability in both native language
(\textsc{Casual-native}) and multilingual (\textsc{Causal-multi}) settings,
outperforming strong baselines on two benchmark datasets covering encyclopedic
and commonsense knowledge QA tasks. Our code and data are open-sourced at
https://github.com/peachch/CausalAbstain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决IP领域RAG系统因用户查询多样性（如口语化表达、拼写错误等）导致的检索不准确和响应不佳问题。

Method: 采用轻量级Data-to-Tune范式，结合提示工程化查询生成和硬负例挖掘，优化检索模型。

Result: 在台湾专利Q&A数据集上，检索准确率提升185.62%（专利咨询数据集）和262.26%（新技术报告数据集），生成质量分别提升14.22%和53.58%。

Conclusion: MQG-RFM通过语义感知的检索优化，为中小机构提供实用、可扩展的专利情报解决方案，已被ScholarMate采用。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in the Intellectual Property
(IP) field often struggle with diverse user queries, including colloquial
expressions, spelling errors, and ambiguous terminology, leading to inaccurate
retrieval and suboptimal responses. To address this challenge, we propose
Multi-Angle Question Generation and Retrieval Fine-Tuning Method (MQG-RFM), a
novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate varied
user inquiries and fine-tunes retrieval models to align semantically equivalent
but linguistically diverse questions. Unlike complex architectural
modifications, MQG-RFM adopts a lightweight Data-to-Tune paradigm, combining
prompt-engineered query generation with hard negative mining to enhance
retrieval robustness without costly infrastructure changes. Experimental
results on a Taiwan patent Q&A dataset show 185.62% improvement in retrieval
accuracy on the Patent Consultation dataset and 262.26% improvement on the
Novel Patent Technology Report dataset, with 14.22% and 53.58% improvements in
generation quality over the baselines, respectively. By bridging the gap
between user intent and system comprehension through semantic-aware retrieval
optimization, MQG-RFM offers a practical, scalable approach for rapid,
cost-effective deployment among small and medium-sized agencies seeking
reliable patent intelligence solutions. Additionally, our proposed method has
already been adopted by ScholarMate, the largest professional research social
networking platform in China, to support real-world development and deployment.

*Changyue Wang,Weihang Su,Qingyao Ai,Yujia Zhou,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DecKER是一种新的知识编辑框架，通过解耦推理和知识编辑，显著提升了多跳问答任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文知识编辑方法未明确分离新注入知识与模型原有推理过程，导致冲突和性能下降。

Method: 提出DecKER框架，生成掩码推理路径并通过混合检索和模型验证解决知识编辑问题。

Result: 在多跳问答基准测试中，DecKER显著优于现有方法，减少了知识冲突并保持推理一致性。

Conclusion: DecKER为轻量级知识编辑提供了有效解决方案，提升了模型在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to efficiently update Large Language Models (LLMs) by
modifying specific knowledge without retraining the entire model. Among
knowledge editing approaches, in-context editing (ICE) offers a lightweight
solution by injecting new knowledge directly into the input context, leaving
model parameters unchanged. However, existing ICE approaches do not explicitly
separate the newly injected knowledge from the model's original reasoning
process. This entanglement often results in conflicts between external updates
and internal parametric knowledge, undermining the consistency and accuracy of
the reasoning path.In this work, we conduct preliminary experiments to examine
how parametric knowledge influences reasoning path planning. We find that the
model's reasoning is tightly coupled with its internal knowledge, and that
naively injecting new information without adapting the reasoning path often
leads to performance degradation, particularly in multi-hop tasks. To this end,
we propose DecKER, a novel ICE framework that decouples reasoning from
knowledge editing by generating a masked reasoning path and then resolving
knowledge edits via hybrid retrieval and model-based validation. Experiments on
multi-hop QA benchmarks show that DecKER significantly outperforms existing ICE
methods by mitigating knowledge conflicts and preserving reasoning consistency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARIA通过将高维语言动作空间映射到低维意图空间，减少奖励稀疏性，提升强化学习效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放语言动作环境中的动作空间巨大且奖励稀疏，导致强化学习效果不佳。

Method: 提出ARIA方法，将自然语言动作投影到低维意图空间，聚类语义相似动作并共享奖励。

Result: ARIA显著降低策略梯度方差，在四项任务中平均性能提升9.95%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ARIA通过意图空间奖励聚合，有效解决了语言动作环境中的奖励稀疏问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents to perform complex reasoning
and decision-making through free-form language interactions. However, in
open-ended language action environments (e.g., negotiation or question-asking
games), the action space can be formulated as a joint distribution over tokens,
resulting in an exponentially large action space. Sampling actions in such a
space can lead to extreme reward sparsity, which brings large reward variance,
hindering effective reinforcement learning (RL). To address this, we propose
ARIA, a method that Aggregates Rewards in Intention space to enable efficient
and effective language Agents training. ARIA aims to project natural language
actions from the high-dimensional joint token distribution space into a
low-dimensional intention space, where semantically similar actions are
clustered and assigned shared rewards. This intention-aware reward aggregation
reduces reward variance by densifying reward signals, fostering better policy
optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARIA not only
significantly reduces policy gradient variance, but also delivers substantial
performance gains of an average of 9.95% across four downstream tasks,
consistently outperforming offline and online RL baselines.

Method: 引入MSumBench，结合多代理辩论系统提升标注质量，评估八种现代摘要模型，并分析大型语言模型作为评估者的表现。

Result: 发现模型在不同领域和语言中的表现差异，并揭示大型语言模型在评估自生成摘要时的系统性偏差。

Conclusion: MSumBench为文本摘要提供了更全面的评估工具，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Evaluation frameworks for text summarization have evolved in terms of both
domain coverage and metrics. However, existing benchmarks still lack
domain-specific assessment criteria, remain predominantly English-centric, and
face challenges with human annotation due to the complexity of reasoning. To
address these, we introduce MSumBench, which provides a multi-dimensional,
multi-domain evaluation of summarization in English and Chinese. It also
incorporates specialized assessment criteria for each domain and leverages a
multi-agent debate system to enhance annotation quality. By evaluating eight
modern summarization models, we discover distinct performance patterns across
domains and languages. We further examine large language models as summary
evaluators, analyzing the correlation between their evaluation and
summarization capabilities, and uncovering systematic bias in their assessment
of self-generated summaries. Our benchmark dataset is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于成本和伦理问题，AI驱动的心理健康研究难以使用真实求助者，因此需要更真实的模拟代理。

Method: AnnaAgent结合情感调节器和抱怨引发器，并采用三级记忆机制，动态控制模拟配置。

Result: 评估显示AnnaAgent在心理咨询中比现有基线更真实地模拟求助者。

Conclusion: AnnaAgent为心理健康AI研究提供了更真实的模拟工具，代码已通过伦理审查。

Abstract: Constrained by the cost and ethical concerns of involving real seekers in
AI-driven mental health, researchers develop LLM-based conversational agents
(CAs) with tailored configurations, such as profiles, symptoms, and scenarios,
to simulate seekers. While these efforts advance AI in mental health, achieving
more realistic seeker simulation remains hindered by two key challenges:
dynamic evolution and multi-session memory. Seekers' mental states often
fluctuate during counseling, which typically spans multiple sessions. To
address this, we propose AnnaAgent, an emotional and cognitive dynamic agent
system equipped with tertiary memory. AnnaAgent incorporates an emotion
modulator and a complaint elicitor trained on real counseling dialogues,
enabling dynamic control of the simulator's configurations. Additionally, its
tertiary memory mechanism effectively integrates short-term and long-term
memory across sessions. Evaluation results, both automated and manual,
demonstrate that AnnaAgent achieves more realistic seeker simulation in
psychological counseling compared to existing baselines. The ethically reviewed

Motivation: 社交媒体中存在大量冒犯性内容，但表情符号的作用尚未被充分研究。表情符号可能通过象征性关联、讽刺或上下文滥用获得有害含义。

Method: 系统分析了表情符号在冒犯性推文中的分布及其模糊性利用方式，并提出了一种基于LLM的多步审核流程，选择性替换有害表情符号。

Result: 人类评估证实该方法能有效降低冒犯性且不牺牲语义，同时揭示了不同冒犯类型中的异质性效果。

Conclusion: 研究为在线交流和表情符号审核提供了细致见解，证明了多步审核方法的有效性。

Abstract: Social media platforms have become central to modern communication, yet they
also harbor offensive content that challenges platform safety and inclusivity.
While prior research has primarily focused on textual indicators of offense,
the role of emojis, ubiquitous visual elements in online discourse, remains
underexplored. Emojis, despite being rarely offensive in isolation, can acquire
harmful meanings through symbolic associations, sarcasm, and contextual misuse.
In this work, we systematically examine emoji contributions to offensive
Twitter messages, analyzing their distribution across offense categories and
how users exploit emoji ambiguity. To address this, we propose an LLM-powered,
multi-step moderation pipeline that selectively replaces harmful emojis while
preserving the tweet's semantic intent. Human evaluations confirm our approach
effectively reduces perceived offensiveness without sacrificing meaning. Our
analysis also reveals heterogeneous effects across offense types, offering
nuanced insights for online communication and emoji moderation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索器模型通常假设知识片段条件独立，忽略了多相关且相关知识的共存问题。

Method: 提出Entriever，通过能量函数定义相关性分数，探索不同能量函数架构和训练方法。

Result: Entriever在知识检索任务中显著优于基线模型，并在半监督对话系统训练中提升端到端性能。

Conclusion: Entriever通过整体建模检索结果，有效解决了知识片段相关性问题，提升了检索和对话系统表现。

Abstract: A retriever, which retrieves relevant knowledge pieces from a knowledge base
given a context, is an important component in many natural language processing
(NLP) tasks. Retrievers have been introduced in knowledge-grounded dialog
systems to improve knowledge acquisition. In knowledge-grounded dialog systems,
when conditioning on a given context, there may be multiple relevant and
correlated knowledge pieces. However, knowledge pieces are usually assumed to
be conditionally independent in current retriever models. To address this
issue, we propose Entriever, an energy-based retriever. Entriever directly
models the candidate retrieval results as a whole instead of modeling the
knowledge pieces separately, with the relevance score defined by an energy
function. We explore various architectures of energy functions and different
training methods for Entriever, and show that Entriever substantially
outperforms the strong cross-encoder baseline in knowledge retrieval tasks.
Furthermore, we show that in semi-supervised training of knowledge-grounded
dialog systems, Entriever enables effective scoring of retrieved knowledge
pieces and significantly improves end-to-end performance of dialog systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合同审查复杂且耗时，需要法律专业知识，对非专家不友好；法律解释模糊且主观，合同保密性限制了专有模型的使用。

Method: PAKTON采用多智能体协作工作流和检索增强生成（RAG）技术，实现端到端的合同分析。

Result: PAKTON在预测准确性、检索性能、可解释性、完整性和合理性方面优于通用和预训练模型。

Conclusion: PAKTON为合同审查提供了更高效、灵活且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Contract review is a complex and time-intensive task that typically demands
specialized legal expertise, rendering it largely inaccessible to non-experts.
Moreover, legal interpretation is rarely straightforward-ambiguity is
pervasive, and judgments often hinge on subjective assessments. Compounding
these challenges, contracts are usually confidential, restricting their use
with proprietary models and necessitating reliance on open-source alternatives.
To address these challenges, we introduce PAKTON: a fully open-source,
end-to-end, multi-agent framework with plug-and-play capabilities. PAKTON is
designed to handle the complexities of contract analysis through collaborative
agent workflows and a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) component,
enabling automated legal document review that is more accessible, adaptable,
and privacy-preserving. Experiments demonstrate that PAKTON outperforms both
general-purpose and pretrained models in predictive accuracy, retrieval
performance, explainability, completeness, and grounded justifications as
evaluated through a human study and validated with automated metrics.

Motivation: 临床任务（如诊断和治疗）需要强大的决策能力，因此需要严格的评估基准来验证LLM的可靠性。

Method: 通过多步语义知识图谱遍历生成临床合理且具有误导性的干扰项，增强多选题数据集的难度。

Result: 在六个常用医疗QA基准测试中，KGGDG显著降低了最先进LLM的准确率。

Conclusion: KGGDG是一种有效工具，可用于更稳健和诊断性的医疗LLM评估。

Abstract: Clinical tasks such as diagnosis and treatment require strong decision-making
abilities, highlighting the importance of rigorous evaluation benchmarks to
assess the reliability of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we
introduce a knowledge-guided data augmentation framework that enhances the
difficulty of clinical multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets by generating
distractors (i.e., incorrect choices that are similar to the correct one and
may confuse existing LLMs). Using our KG-based pipeline, the generated choices
are both clinically plausible and deliberately misleading. Our approach
involves multi-step, semantically informed walks on a medical knowledge graph
to identify distractor paths-associations that are medically relevant but
factually incorrect-which then guide the LLM in crafting more deceptive
distractors. We apply the designed knowledge graph guided distractor generation
(KGGDG) pipline, to six widely used medical QA benchmarks and show that it
consistently reduces the accuracy of state-of-the-art LLMs. These findings
establish KGGDG as a powerful tool for enabling more robust and diagnostic
evaluations of medical LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在构建检索器训练数据时存在三个主要问题：未考虑示例的协同效应、未充分纳入查询的语言特征、评分未直接优化DST性能。

Method: 提出CombiSearch，基于组合效应对上下文示例进行评分，优化检索器的训练数据。

Result: 在MultiWOZ上评估，CombiSearch超越现有方法，数据效率提升20倍，并在SGD数据集上表现良好；无检索错误时，DST性能上限提升12%。

Conclusion: CombiSearch显著提升了DST性能，揭示了现有方法依赖次优训练数据的问题。

Abstract: In dialogue state tracking (DST), in-context learning comprises a retriever
that selects labeled dialogues as in-context examples and a DST model that uses
these examples to infer the dialogue state of the query dialogue. Existing
methods for constructing training data for retrievers suffer from three key
limitations: (1) the synergistic effect of examples is not considered, (2) the
linguistic characteristics of the query are not sufficiently factored in, and
(3) scoring is not directly optimized for DST performance. Consequently, the
retriever can fail to retrieve examples that would substantially improve DST
performance. To address these issues, we present CombiSearch, a method that
scores effective in-context examples based on their combinatorial impact on DST
performance. Our evaluation on MultiWOZ shows that retrievers trained with
CombiSearch surpass state-of-the-art models, achieving a 20x gain in data
efficiency and generalizing well to the SGD dataset. Moreover, CombiSearch
attains a 12% absolute improvement in the upper bound DST performance over
traditional approaches when no retrieval errors are assumed. This significantly
increases the headroom for practical DST performance while demonstrating that
existing methods rely on suboptimal data for retriever training.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决LID模型在带口音语音上性能显著下降的问题，并深入探索错误的具体原因和特征。

Method: 方法包括识别LID系统在带口音语音上的常见错误模式，提出通过输入分块增强模型鲁棒性，并引入序列级信息以减少口音与语言的混淆。

Result: 结果显示，提出的方法显著提升了模型在带口音语音上的性能，同时保持了标准LID任务上的可比结果。

Conclusion: 结论是，通过简单的输入分块和序列级信息整合，可以有效提升LID模型对带口音语音的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Prior research indicates that LID model performance significantly declines on
accented speech; however, the specific causes, extent, and characterization of
these errors remain under-explored. (i) We identify a common failure mode on
accented speech whereby LID systems often misclassify L2 accented speech as the
speaker's native language or a related language. (ii) We present evidence
suggesting that state-of-the-art models are invariant to permutations of short
spans of speech, implying they classify on the basis of short phonotactic
features indicative of accent rather than language. Our analysis reveals a
simple method to enhance model robustness to accents through input chunking.
(iii) We present an approach that integrates sequence-level information into
our model without relying on monolingual ASR systems; this reduces
accent-language confusion and significantly enhances performance on accented
speech while maintaining comparable results on standard LID.

Method: 结合人工和大语言模型标注，对Craigslist非结构化广告进行邻里分类，并进行地理空间分析和主题建模。

Result: 发现三种模式：邻里定义冲突、边界属性及声誉洗白；远离中心的广告强调不同设施。

Conclusion: 自然语言处理技术能揭示传统方法忽略的城市空间定义争议。

Abstract: Rental listings offer a unique window into how urban space is socially
constructed through language. We analyze Chicago Craigslist rental
advertisements from 2018 to 2024 to examine how listing agents characterize
neighborhoods, identifying mismatches between institutional boundaries and
neighborhood claims. Through manual and large language model annotation, we
classify unstructured listings from Craigslist according to their neighborhood.
Geospatial analysis reveals three distinct patterns: properties with
conflicting neighborhood designations due to competing spatial definitions,
border properties with valid claims to adjacent neighborhoods, and ``reputation
laundering" where listings claim association with distant, desirable
neighborhoods. Through topic modeling, we identify patterns that correlate with
spatial positioning: listings further from neighborhood centers emphasize
different amenities than centrally-located units. Our findings demonstrate that
natural language processing techniques can reveal how definitions of urban
spaces are contested in ways that traditional methods overlook.

Conclusion: 为越南语音频毒性检测建立了新基准，推动了语音内容审核的未来研究。

Abstract: Toxic speech on online platforms is a growing concern, impacting user
experience and online safety. While text-based toxicity detection is
well-studied, audio-based approaches remain underexplored, especially for
low-resource languages like Vietnamese. This paper introduces ViToSA
(Vietnamese Toxic Spans Audio), the first dataset for toxic spans detection in
Vietnamese speech, comprising 11,000 audio samples (25 hours) with accurate
human-annotated transcripts. We propose a pipeline that combines ASR and toxic
spans detection for fine-grained identification of toxic content. Our
experiments show that fine-tuning ASR models on ViToSA significantly reduces
WER when transcribing toxic speech, while the text-based toxic spans detection
(TSD) models outperform existing baselines. These findings establish a novel
benchmark for Vietnamese audio-based toxic spans detection, paving the way for
future research in speech content moderation.

Motivation: 模型置信度分数校准不佳会影响文本生成模型的实用性，尤其是在存在多个有效答案的情况下。

Method: 提出了一种仅依赖模型输出概率的任务无关置信度度量方法，无需额外微调或启发式规则。

Result: 在BART和Flan-T5模型上，该方法在摘要、翻译和问答任务中改善了置信度校准。

Conclusion: 该方法为文本生成模型的置信度校准提供了一种简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Well-calibrated model confidence scores can improve the usefulness of text
generation models. For example, users can be prompted to review predictions
with low confidence scores, to prevent models from returning bad or potentially
dangerous predictions. However, confidence metrics are not always well
calibrated in text generation. One reason is that in generation, there can be
many valid answers, which previous methods do not always account for. Hence, a
confident model could distribute its output probability among multiple
sequences because they are all valid. We propose task-agnostic confidence
metrics suited to generation, which rely solely on the probabilities associated
with the model outputs without the need for further fine-tuning or heuristics.
Using these, we are able to improve the calibration of BART and Flan-T5 on
summarization, translation, and QA datasets.

*Weijie Xu,Shixian Cui,Xi Fang,Chi Xue,Stephanie Eckman,Chandan Reddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SATA-BENCH，首个用于评估大语言模型（LLM）在“选择所有适用项”（SATA）任务上的基准测试，揭示了LLM在多答案推理中的不足，并提出了一种名为Choice Funnel的解码策略以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM主要针对单答案任务评估，而现实问题常需识别多个正确答案，这一能力尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出SATA-BENCH基准测试，评估27种开源和专有模型，并设计Choice Funnel策略（结合标记去偏和自适应阈值）以解决选择偏差和计数偏差问题。

Result: 最强模型仅达41.8%的精确匹配率，Choice Funnel将性能提升29%，同时降低64%推理成本。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在多答案任务中的局限性，并提供了诊断和改进框架，推动LLM在现实多答案应用中的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on single-answer
multiple-choice tasks, yet many real-world problems require identifying all
correct answers from a set of options. This capability remains underexplored.
We introduce SATA-BENCH, the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating LLMs on
Select All That Apply (SATA) questions across diverse domains, including
reading comprehension, law, and biomedicine. Our evaluation of 27 open-source
and proprietary models reveals a significant gap: even the strongest model
achieves only 41.8% exact match, exposing LLMs' inability to reliably identify
all correct answers. We find that this weakness stems from two core challenges:
selection bias - models favor certain choices regardless of content, and count
bias - models fail to predict the correct number of answers. To address these
issues, we propose Choice Funnel, a decoding strategy that combines token
debiasing with adaptive thresholding to guide models toward complete and
accurate selections. Choice Funnel achieves up to 29% higher exact match than
competitive baselines while reducing inference cost by over 64%. Our findings
expose fundamental limitations in current LLMs and introduce a new framework
for diagnosing and improving multi-answer reasoning. We release SATA-BENCH and
Choice Funnel to promote LLM development for robust decision-making in
realistic, multi-answer applications.

Abstract: Stuttering is a complex disorder that requires specialized expertise for
effective assessment and treatment. This paper presents an effort to enhance
the FluencyBank dataset with a new stuttering annotation scheme based on
established clinical standards. To achieve high-quality annotations, we hired
expert clinicians to label the data, ensuring that the resulting annotations
mirror real-world clinical expertise. The annotations are multi-modal,
incorporating audiovisual features for the detection and classification of
stuttering moments, secondary behaviors, and tension scores. In addition to
individual annotations, we additionally provide a test set with highly reliable
annotations based on expert consensus for assessing individual annotators and
machine learning models. Our experiments and analysis illustrate the complexity
of this task that necessitates extensive clinical expertise for valid training
and evaluation of stuttering assessment models.

TL;DR: GUIDEX是一种新方法，通过自动定义领域特定模式、推断指南并生成合成标记实例，提升零样本信息提取的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信息提取系统需要领域专家设计模式和数据标注，成本高；大语言模型在零样本任务中表现不佳，尤其是在未见过的领域。

Method: GUIDEX自动生成领域特定模式、指南和合成标记数据，并利用Llama 3.1进行微调。

Result: 在七个零样本命名实体识别基准测试中达到新SOTA，比之前方法提升7 F1点（无需人工标注数据），结合人工标注数据时提升近2 F1点。

Conclusion: GUIDEX显著提升模型对复杂领域特定模式的理解能力，代码、模型和合成数据集已开源。

Abstract: Information Extraction (IE) systems are traditionally domain-specific,
requiring costly adaptation that involves expert schema design, data
annotation, and model training. While Large Language Models have shown promise
in zero-shot IE, performance degrades significantly in unseen domains where
label definitions differ. This paper introduces GUIDEX, a novel method that
automatically defines domain-specific schemas, infers guidelines, and generates
synthetically labeled instances, allowing for better out-of-domain
generalization. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 with GUIDEX sets a new state-of-the-art
across seven zeroshot Named Entity Recognition benchmarks. Models trained with
GUIDEX gain up to 7 F1 points over previous methods without humanlabeled data,
and nearly 2 F1 points higher when combined with it. Models trained on GUIDEX
demonstrate enhanced comprehension of complex, domain-specific annotation
schemas. Code, models, and synthetic datasets are available at

Conclusion: 基于情感的提示技术在讽刺分类和生成中表现优越，为理解讽刺提供了新方法。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a form of humor where expressions convey meanings opposite to
their literal interpretations. Classifying and generating sarcasm using large
language models is vital for interpreting human communication. Sarcasm poses
challenges for computational models, due to its nuanced nature. We introduce
Sarc7, a benchmark that classifies 7 types of sarcasm: self-deprecating,
brooding, deadpan, polite, obnoxious, raging, and manic by annotating entries
of the MUStARD dataset. Classification was evaluated using zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought (CoT), and a novel emotion-based prompting technique. We
propose an emotion-based generation method developed by identifying key
components of sarcasm-incongruity, shock value, and context dependency. Our
classification experiments show that Gemini 2.5, using emotion-based prompting,
outperforms other setups with an F1 score of 0.3664. Human evaluators preferred
our emotion-based prompting, with 38.46% more successful generations than
zero-shot prompting.

Result: 实验表明，STREAM显著优于现有防御技术，将攻击成功率（ASR）降低了51.2%，同时保持LLM的功能。

Conclusion: STREAM是一种有效的防御机制，能够显著减少多轮对话攻击的成功率，同时不影响LLMs的核心功能。

Abstract: Malicious attackers can exploit large language models (LLMs) by engaging them
in multi-turn dialogues to achieve harmful objectives, posing significant
safety risks to society. To address this challenge, we propose a novel defense
mechanism: SafeTy Reasoning Elicitation Alignment for Multi-Turn Dialogues
(STREAM). STREAM defends LLMs against multi-turn attacks while preserving their
functional capabilities. Our approach involves constructing a human-annotated
dataset, the Safety Reasoning Multi-turn Dialogues dataset, which is used to
fine-tune a plug-and-play safety reasoning moderator. This model is designed to
identify malicious intent hidden within multi-turn conversations and alert the
target LLM of potential risks. We evaluate STREAM across multiple LLMs against
prevalent multi-turn attack strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms existing defense techniques, reducing the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 51.2%, all while maintaining comparable LLM
capability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化评估大型语言模型（LLM）在生成法律论据任务中的表现的方法，重点关注忠实性、因素利用和适当弃权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在复杂法律任务中表现出潜力，但其可靠性仍存疑，需要评估其在生成法律论据时的表现。

Method: 采用自动化流程，利用外部LLM提取生成论据中的因素，并与输入案例的真实因素对比，评估八种LLM在三种难度递增测试中的表现。

Result: LLM在避免幻觉方面表现良好（准确率超90%），但在因素利用和弃权能力上存在不足。

Conclusion: 自动化流程为评估LLM行为提供了可扩展方法，但需改进因素利用和弃权能力以确保法律场景中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in complex legal tasks
like argument generation, yet their reliability remains a concern. Building
upon pilot work assessing LLM generation of 3-ply legal arguments using human
evaluation, this paper introduces an automated pipeline to evaluate LLM
performance on this task, specifically focusing on faithfulness (absence of
hallucination), factor utilization, and appropriate abstention. We define
hallucination as the generation of factors not present in the input case
materials and abstention as the model's ability to refrain from generating
arguments when instructed and no factual basis exists. Our automated method
employs an external LLM to extract factors from generated arguments and
compares them against the ground-truth factors provided in the input case
triples (current case and two precedent cases). We evaluated eight distinct
LLMs on three tests of increasing difficulty: 1) generating a standard 3-ply
argument, 2) generating an argument with swapped precedent roles, and 3)
recognizing the impossibility of argument generation due to lack of shared
factors and abstaining. Our findings indicate that while current LLMs achieve
high accuracy (over 90%) in avoiding hallucination on viable argument
generation tests (Tests 1 & 2), they often fail to utilize the full set of
relevant factors present in the cases. Critically, on the abstention test (Test
3), most models failed to follow instructions to stop, instead generating
spurious arguments despite the lack of common factors. This automated pipeline
provides a scalable method for assessing these crucial LLM behaviors,
highlighting the need for improvements in factor utilization and robust
abstention capabilities before reliable deployment in legal settings. Project

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个将论证性文本转换为论证知识图（AKG）的框架，通过丰富节点属性和识别隐含推理规则，提升论证结构的可视化和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的论证数据集难以检测隐含的推理规则和间接关系，限制了论证结构的理解和推理能力。

Method: 从基础标注的论证组件和关系出发，构建知识库图，应用假言推理形成论证，并创建具有丰富属性的AKG。

Result: AKG能够识别之前无法检测的削弱攻击，并提供更易理解的论证结构视图。

Conclusion: AKG为未来的推理任务（如论证连贯性检查和修订机会识别）奠定了基础，并有助于学习隐含的间接关系。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework to convert argumentative texts into argument
knowledge graphs (AKG). Starting with basic annotations of argumentative
components (ACs) and argumentative relations (ARs), we enrich the information
by constructing a knowledge base (KB) graph with metadata attributes for nodes.
Next, we use premises and inference rules from the KB to form arguments by
applying modus ponens. From these arguments, we create an AKG. The nodes and
edges of the AKG have attributes that capture important argumentative features.
We also find missing inference rules by identifying markers. This makes it
possible to identify undercut attacks that were previously undetectable in
existing datasets. The AKG gives a graphical view of the argumentative
structure that is easier to understand than theoretical formats. It also
prepares the ground for future reasoning tasks, including checking the
coherence of arguments and identifying opportunities for revision. For this, it
is important to find indirect relations, many of which are implicit. Our
proposed AKG format, with annotated inference rules and modus ponens, will help
reasoning models learn the implicit indirect relations that require inference
over arguments and the relations between them.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端语音对话系统需要大规模训练数据且生成的响应缺乏语义连贯性，因此需要一种更高效且语义一致的方法。

Method: 采用链式思维（CoT）策略，将对话数据训练与多模态语言模型的预训练（如语音识别、文本生成等）紧密结合。

Result: 在仅300小时的公开对话数据上训练，实现了比基线模型1.5 ROUGE-1的提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在少量数据上高效训练语音对话系统，效果显著，并将公开模型和训练代码。

Abstract: Unlike traditional cascaded pipelines, end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue
systems preserve full differentiability and capture non-phonemic information,
making them well-suited for modeling spoken interactions. However, existing E2E
approaches often require large-scale training data and generates responses
lacking semantic coherence. We propose a simple yet effective strategy
leveraging a chain-of-thought (CoT) formulation, ensuring that training on
conversational data remains closely aligned with the multimodal language model
(LM)'s pre-training on speech recognition~(ASR), text-to-speech synthesis
(TTS), and text LM tasks. Our method achieves over 1.5 ROUGE-1 improvement over
the baseline, successfully training spoken dialogue systems on publicly
available human-human conversation datasets, while being compute-efficient
enough to train on just 300 hours of public human-human conversation data, such
as the Switchboard. We will publicly release our models and training code.

Abstract: This paper presents a gradient-informed fine-tuning method for large language
models under few-shot conditions. The goal is to enhance task adaptability and
training stability when data is limited. The method builds on a base loss
function and introduces two gradient-related regularization terms. The first
enforces gradient direction consistency to guide parameter updates along
task-relevant directions and prevent drift. The second controls gradient
magnitude to avoid abnormal updates. Together, these components support a more
efficient and stable optimization path. To further improve cross-task
generalization, the method incorporates a gradient alignment mechanism. This
mechanism measures the consistency between optimization directions of the
source and target tasks. It enhances fine-tuning performance in multi-task and
cross-domain scenarios. Across various natural language understanding tasks,
the method outperforms existing fine-tuning strategies in average accuracy,
gradient stability, and directional alignment. Empirical evaluations under
different sample sizes and domain-specific tasks confirm the method's
robustness and broad applicability in low-resource environments. In particular,
the method shows clear advantages in controlling parameter update paths. The
results demonstrate that a gradient-based fine-tuning framework can effectively
leverage the representational power of large language models. It ensures
training stability while reducing dependence on large volumes of labeled data.

Abstract: Narrative frames are a powerful way of conceptualizing and communicating
complex, controversial ideas, however automated frame analysis to date has
mostly overlooked this framing device. In this paper, we connect elements of
narrativity with fundamental aspects of framing, and present a framework which
formalizes and operationalizes such aspects. We annotate and release a data set
of news articles in the climate change domain, analyze the dominance of
narrative frame components across political leanings, and test LLMs in their
ability to predict narrative frames and their components. Finally, we apply our
framework in an unsupervised way to elicit components of narrative framing in a
second domain, the COVID-19 crisis, where our predictions are congruent with
prior theoretical work showing the generalizability of our approach.

Abstract: In video dubbing, aligning translated audio with the source audio is a
significant challenge. Our focus is on achieving this efficiently, tailored for
real-time, on-device video dubbing scenarios. We developed a phoneme-based

Additionally, we introduced length-aware beam search (LABS), an efficient
approach to generate translations of different lengths in a single decoding

Conclusion: Data Swarms能优化多目标组合并泛化至未见的LLM，为LLM评估提供高效数据生成方法。

Abstract: We propose Data Swarms, an algorithm to optimize the generation of synthetic
evaluation data and advance quantitative desiderata of LLM evaluation. We first
train a swarm of initial data generators using existing data, and define
various evaluation objectives to reflect the desired properties of evaluation
(e.g., generate more difficult problems for the evaluated models) and
quantitatively evaluate data generators. We then employ particle swarm
optimization to optimize the swarm of data generators, where they
collaboratively search through the model parameter space to find new generators
that advance these objectives. We further extend it to Adversarial Swarms,
where the data generator swarm generates harder data while the test taker model
swarm learns from such data, co-evolving dynamically for better data and models
simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Data Swarms outperforms
eight data generation baselines across five evaluation objectives, while
Adversarial Swarms produce more robust learning of synthetic data and stronger
generalization. Further analysis reveals that Data Swarms successfully
optimizes compositions of multiple evaluation objectives and generalizes to new
off-the-shelf LLMs, unseen at optimization time.

Conclusion: 该方法在联邦学习中高效实现了PEFT，显著降低了通信和计算成本，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has become the de-facto approach in
adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for downstream tasks in Natural Language
Processing. However, its adoption in privacy-preserving distributed learning
frameworks, such as Federated Learning (FL), remains relatively limited. This
is mainly due to challenges specific to FL, such as resource-constrained
devices and diverse data distributions among clients. In this paper, we propose
an efficient method to perform PEFT within the FL framework for Multi-Head
Attention (MHA) based language models. We address the challenges through head
pruning, a novel head-specific weighted aggregation mechanism, and a client
selection strategy. Head pruning minimizes training complexity within the
clients, guided by the importance score computed based on the confidence of the
attention head. Weighted aggregation of heads ensures the global model captures
crucial updates from diverse clients complementing our client selection
strategy. We show results on the MultiNLI benchmark along with 20 Newsgroups,
XL-Sum, and E2E NLG datasets. We use the MultiNLI dataset and T5-small model
with LoRA as our PEFT method, attaining sparsity levels of up to 90%, resulting
in a communication advantage of up to 1.8x and a reduction in training OPs of
3.9x while maintaining the accuracy drop under 2%.

Method: 引入TWC数据集（3,950个挑战性场景），评估多种技术（如GPT-4、mBART-50、NLLB-200、Google Translate）的表现，并通过微调mBART-50改善结果。

Result: 所有模型在无性别内容翻译中表现不佳，倾向于使用男性代词，尤其是Google Translate和GPT-4在领导力和职业成功场景中男性代词使用频率是女性的4-6倍。微调mBART-50显著减少了偏见和错误。

Conclusion: 需要针对性别和语义一致性采取专门方法，特别是在无性别语言翻译中，以实现更公平和准确的翻译系统。

Abstract: Addressing gender bias and maintaining logical coherence in machine
translation remains challenging, particularly when translating between natural
gender languages, like English, and genderless languages, such as Persian,
Indonesian, and Finnish. We introduce the Translate-with-Care (TWC) dataset,
comprising 3,950 challenging scenarios across six low- to mid-resource
languages, to assess translation systems' performance. Our analysis of diverse
technologies, including GPT-4, mBART-50, NLLB-200, and Google Translate,
reveals a universal struggle in translating genderless content, resulting in
gender stereotyping and reasoning errors. All models preferred masculine
pronouns when gender stereotypes could influence choices. Google Translate and
GPT-4 showed particularly strong bias, favoring male pronouns 4-6 times more
than feminine ones in leadership and professional success contexts. Fine-tuning
mBART-50 on TWC substantially resolved these biases and errors, led to strong
generalization, and surpassed proprietary LLMs while remaining open-source.
This work emphasizes the need for targeted approaches to gender and semantic
coherence in machine translation, particularly for genderless languages,
contributing to more equitable and accurate translation systems.

TL;DR: LLMs存在跨语言隐私泄露风险，研究发现隐私信息在中间层处理，通过去激活特定神经元可降低风险。

Motivation: 研究LLMs在多语言环境下隐私泄露问题，填补现有研究仅关注英语的不足。

Method: 分析跨语言隐私泄露的信息流，识别隐私通用神经元和语言特定神经元，并通过去激活降低风险。

Result: 去激活相关神经元后，跨语言隐私泄露风险降低23.3%-31.6%。

Conclusion: 跨语言隐私泄露需关注神经元特性，去激活特定神经元是有效缓解手段。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on massive data capture rich information
embedded in the training data. However, this also introduces the risk of
privacy leakage, particularly involving personally identifiable information
(PII). Although previous studies have shown that this risk can be mitigated
through methods such as privacy neurons, they all assume that both the
(sensitive) training data and user queries are in English. We show that they
cannot defend against the privacy leakage in cross-lingual contexts: even if
the training data is exclusively in one language, these (private) models may
still reveal private information when queried in another language. In this
work, we first investigate the information flow of cross-lingual privacy
leakage to give a better understanding. We find that LLMs process private
information in the middle layers, where representations are largely shared
across languages. The risk of leakage peaks when converted to a
language-specific space in later layers. Based on this, we identify
privacy-universal neurons and language-specific privacy neurons.
Privacy-universal neurons influence privacy leakage across all languages, while
language-specific privacy neurons are only related to specific languages. By
deactivating these neurons, the cross-lingual privacy leakage risk is reduced
by 23.3%-31.6%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将长文本固定分割，可能导致语义相关内容的分离，影响理解准确性。

Method: 通过计算相邻句子的语义相似度动态分割文本，并训练问题感知分类器选择关键文本块。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLMs对长文本的理解能力，具有鲁棒性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately read and comprehend
extremely long texts. Current methods for improvement typically rely on
splitting long contexts into fixed-length chunks. However, fixed truncation
risks separating semantically relevant content, leading to ambiguity and
compromising accurate understanding. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
straightforward approach for dynamically separating and selecting chunks of
long context, facilitating a more streamlined input for LLMs. In particular, we
compute semantic similarities between adjacent sentences, using lower
similarities to adaptively divide long contexts into variable-length chunks. We
further train a question-aware classifier to select sensitive chunks that are
critical for answering specific questions. Experimental results on both
single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks show that the proposed
approach consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, it maintains
robustness across a wide range of input lengths, handling sequences of up to
256k tokens. Our datasets and code are available at the following link:

Conclusion: 结构化输出和领域适应技术能显著提升LLM-as-the-Judge在生物医学关系抽取中的评估性能，相关数据已公开。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in
biomedical relation extraction, even in zero-shot scenarios. However,
evaluating LLMs in this task remains challenging due to their ability to
generate human-like text, often producing synonyms or abbreviations of
gold-standard answers, making traditional automatic evaluation metrics
unreliable. On the other hand, while human evaluation is more reliable, it is
costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for real-world applications.
This paper investigates the use of LLMs-as-the-Judge as an alternative
evaluation method for biomedical relation extraction. We benchmark 8 LLMs as
judges to evaluate the responses generated by 5 other LLMs across 3 biomedical
relation extraction datasets. Unlike other text-generation tasks, we observe
that LLM-based judges perform quite poorly (usually below 50% accuracy) in the
biomedical relation extraction task. Our findings reveal that it happens mainly
because relations extracted by LLMs do not adhere to any standard format. To
address this, we propose structured output formatting for LLM-generated
responses that helps LLM-Judges to improve their performance by about 15% (on
average). We also introduce a domain adaptation technique to further enhance
LLM-Judge performance by effectively transferring knowledge between datasets.
We release both our human-annotated and LLM-annotated judgment data (36k
samples in total) for public use here:

Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理任务中缺乏可解释性和可信度，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出KG-TRACES框架，联合监督模型预测关系路径、推理路径，并生成基于推理路径的归因感知推理过程。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ任务中，Hits@1和F1分数显著提升，并展示了在医学等领域的迁移能力。

Conclusion: KG-TRACES通过显式监督实现了更稳定和可解释的推理过程，适用于KG可用和不可用场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in various natural
language processing tasks, but their performance on complex reasoning problems
remains hindered by a lack of explainability and trustworthiness. This issue,
often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes,
limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we
propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain
Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the
reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and
processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic
relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate
attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At
inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable
scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting
plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design
enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern.
Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that
KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6%
and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1%
in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such
as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we
further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to
more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with
correct answers. Code is available at https://github.com/Edaizi/KG-TRACES.

Motivation: 提升语言技术的文化能力，但现有研究多依赖合成设置和不完美的文化代理，缺乏与社区的互动。

Method: 通过访谈跨学科研究者，构建研究文化的结构、风格、修辞和引用规范框架，并开发计算指标。

Result: 成功量化人类研究论文中的潜在文化规范，并揭示LLM在文化能力上的不足及其同质化写作倾向。

Conclusion: 以人为中心的方法能有效衡量人类和LLM生成文本中的文化规范。

Abstract: Improving cultural competence of language technologies is important. However
most recent works rarely engage with the communities they study, and instead
rely on synthetic setups and imperfect proxies of culture. In this work, we
take a human-centered approach to discover and measure language-based cultural
norms, and cultural competence of LLMs. We focus on a single kind of culture,
research cultures, and a single task, adapting writing across research
cultures. Through a set of interviews with interdisciplinary researchers, who
are experts at moving between cultures, we create a framework of structural,
stylistic, rhetorical, and citational norms that vary across research cultures.
We operationalise these features with a suite of computational metrics and use
them for (a) surfacing latent cultural norms in human-written research papers
at scale; and (b) highlighting the lack of cultural competence of LLMs, and
their tendency to homogenise writing. Overall, our work illustrates the
efficacy of a human-centered approach to measuring cultural norms in
human-written and LLM-generated texts.

Motivation: 现有评估很少测试RAG系统在真实世界噪声、内外检索上下文冲突或快速变化事实中的表现，因此需要更全面的鲁棒性评估。

Method: 提出RARE框架，包括知识图谱驱动的合成管道（RARE-Get）生成问题集（RARE-Set），并定义检索条件鲁棒性指标（RARE-Met）。

Result: RAG系统对扰动表现出显著脆弱性，文档鲁棒性是最薄弱环节，多跳查询鲁棒性普遍低于单跳查询。

Conclusion: RARE为RAG系统提供了全面的鲁棒性评估框架，揭示了其在动态环境中的局限性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances recency and factuality in
answers. However, existing evaluations rarely test how well these systems cope
with real-world noise, conflicting between internal and external retrieved
contexts, or fast-changing facts. We introduce Retrieval-Aware Robustness
Evaluation (RARE), a unified framework and large-scale benchmark that jointly
stress-tests query and document perturbations over dynamic, time-sensitive
corpora. One of the central features of RARE is a knowledge-graph-driven
synthesis pipeline (RARE-Get) that automatically extracts single and multi-hop
relations from the customized corpus and generates multi-level question sets
without manual intervention. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct a dataset
(RARE-Set) spanning 400 expert-level time-sensitive finance, economics, and
policy documents and 48,322 questions whose distribution evolves as the
underlying sources change. To quantify resilience, we formalize
retrieval-conditioned robustness metrics (RARE-Met) that capture a model's
ability to remain correct or recover when queries, documents, or real-world
retrieval results are systematically altered. Our results show that RAG systems
exhibit surprising vulnerability to perturbations, with document robustness
consistently being the weakest point regardless of generator size or
architecture. RAG systems consistently show lower robustness on multi-hop
queries than single-hop queries across all domains.

Result: 在四个基准测试中，FOCUS显著提升了开源和黑盒模型的性能。

Conclusion: FOCUS通过结合不同认知策略和精细化视觉信息，实现了卓越性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with complex
reasoning tasks in Visual Question Answering (VQA). While current methods have
advanced by incorporating visual prompts, our study uncovers critical
limitations: these approaches indiscriminately annotate all detected objects
for every visual question, generating excessive visual markers that degrade
task performance. This issue stems primarily from a lack of focus on key visual
elements, raising two important questions: Are all objects equally important,
and do all questions require visual prompts? Motivated by Dual Process Theory,
which distinguishes between instinctive and deliberate cognitive modes in human
reasoning, we propose FOCUS, a plug-and-play approach that dynamically adapts
to the complexity of questions, combining fast intuitive judgments with
deliberate analytical reasoning to enhance the vision-language reasoning
capability of the MLLM. For straightforward questions, FOCUS supports efficient
zero-shot reasoning. For more complex tasks, it employs the conceptualizing
before observation strategy to highlight critical elements. Extensive
experiments on four benchmarks, ScienceQA, TextQA, VizWiz, and MME, demonstrate
that FOCUS consistently improves the performance of both open-source and
black-box MLLMs, achieving significant gains across all datasets. Ablation
studies further validate the importance of combining diverse cognitive
strategies with refined visual information for superior performance. Code will
be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估VLMs在模拟人类创造力方面的能力，尤其是在嘈杂和多样化的现实场景中。

Method: 从Minecraft游戏“Guess the Build”中收集1500张图像并设计2000个问题，涵盖静态和动态图像设置、不同完整度的自然语言提示等。

Result: GPT-4o在34%的实例中表现不佳，开源模型与API模型之间存在显著性能差距（13.87% vs. 53.93%）。微调后视觉感知任务平均提升15.36%。

Conclusion: GuessBench揭示了VLMs在创造力建模中的挑战，尤其是对低资源语言和文化背景的不足，同时展示了其改进潜力。

Abstract: We propose GuessBench, a novel benchmark that evaluates Vision Language
Models (VLMs) on modeling the pervasive, noisy, and pluralistic human
creativity. GuessBench sources data from "Guess the Build", an online
multiplayer Minecraft minigame where one player constructs a Minecraft build
given a concept (e.g. caterpillar) and others try to guess it with natural
language hints, presenting a pristine testbed for sensemaking creativity in the
wild with VLMs acting as guessers. We curate 1500 images from the actual
gameplay and design 2000 problems spanning static and dynamic image settings,
natural language hints of varying completeness, and more. Extensive experiments
with six open/API VLMs and five reasoning enhancement approaches demonstrate
that GuessBench presents a uniquely challenging task in creativity modeling:
even the start-of-the-art GPT-4o is incorrect on 34% of instances, while we
observe a huge performance gap (13.87% vs. 53.93% on average) between open and
API models. When used as a resource to improve VLMs, fine-tuning on the
reasoning traces for GuessBench problems improves visual perception tasks by
15.36% on average. Further analysis reveals that VLM performance in creativity
sensemaking correlates with the frequency of the concept in training data,
while the accuracy drops sharply for concepts in underrepresented cultural
contexts and low-resource languages.

Method: 构建了将英语散文翻译为梵语诗歌的数据集，并评估了多种生成模型，采用约束解码和指令微调策略。

Result: 约束解码策略在生成符合语法的诗歌形式上达到99%的准确率，指令微调模型在语义和风格对齐上表现更好。

Conclusion: LLM可通过特定策略适应低资源语言的诗歌生成，但需权衡韵律精度与语义对齐。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved
natural language generation, including creative tasks like poetry composition.
However, most progress remains concentrated in high-resource languages. This
raises an important question: Can LLMs be adapted for structured poetic
generation in a low-resource, morphologically rich language such as Sanskrit?
In this work, we introduce a dataset designed for translating English prose
into structured Sanskrit verse, with strict adherence to classical metrical
patterns, particularly the Anushtub meter. We evaluate a range of generative
models-both open-source and proprietary-under multiple settings. Specifically,
we explore constrained decoding strategies and instruction-based fine-tuning
tailored to metrical and semantic fidelity. Our decoding approach achieves over
99% accuracy in producing syntactically valid poetic forms, substantially
outperforming general-purpose models in meter conformity. Meanwhile,
instruction-tuned variants show improved alignment with source meaning and
poetic style, as supported by human assessments, albeit with marginal
trade-offs in metrical precision.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast world knowledge but struggle to stay
up-to-date, often leading to errors and hallucinations. Knowledge editing
offers an efficient alternative to retraining, enabling targeted modifications
by updating specific model parameters. However, existing methods primarily
focus on individual models, posing challenges in efficiently updating multiple
models and adapting to new models. To address this, we propose OnceEdit, a
novel ensemble-based approach that employs a plug-in model as the editing
module, enabling stable knowledge updates across multiple models. Building on
the model ensemble, OnceEdit introduces two key mechanisms to enhance its
effectiveness. First, we introduce a dynamic weight mechanism through a \weight
token for distinguishing between edit-related and non-edit-related instances,
ensuring the appropriate utilization of knowledge from integrated models.
Second, we incorporate an ensemble enhancement mechanism to mitigate the
excessive reliance on the central model inherent in the model ensemble
technique, making it more suitable for knowledge editing. Extensive experiments
on diverse LLMs demonstrate that OnceEdit consistently outperforms existing
methods while achieving superior editing efficiency. Further analysis confirms
its adaptability and stability in multi-model editing scenarios. Our code will
be available.

Result: 更强模型在逻辑否定中表现更优；真相探针能泛化到逻辑转换、问答任务等场景。

Conclusion: 真相方向的研究为理解LLM内部信念提供了新视角，真相探针的应用有望提升用户信任。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on extensive datasets that
encapsulate substantial world knowledge. However, their outputs often include
confidently stated inaccuracies. Earlier works suggest that LLMs encode
truthfulness as a distinct linear feature, termed the "truth direction", which
can classify truthfulness reliably. We address several open questions about the
truth direction: (i) whether LLMs universally exhibit consistent truth
directions; (ii) whether sophisticated probing techniques are necessary to
identify truth directions; and (iii) how the truth direction generalizes across
diverse contexts. Our findings reveal that not all LLMs exhibit consistent
truth directions, with stronger representations observed in more capable
models, particularly in the context of logical negation. Additionally, we
demonstrate that truthfulness probes trained on declarative atomic statements
can generalize effectively to logical transformations, question-answering
tasks, in-context learning, and external knowledge sources. Finally, we explore
the practical application of truthfulness probes in selective
question-answering, illustrating their potential to improve user trust in LLM
outputs. These results advance our understanding of truth directions and
provide new insights into the internal representations of LLM beliefs. Our code

Conclusion: HERGC通过结合异构表示和生成式推理，有效解决了MMKGC问题，展示了生成式方法在多模态场景中的潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) enrich traditional knowledge graphs (KGs)
by incorporating diverse modalities such as images and text. Multi-modal
knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) seeks to exploit these heterogeneous signals
to infer missing facts, thereby mitigating the intrinsic incompleteness of
MMKGs. Existing MMKGC methods typically leverage only the information contained
in the MMKGs under the closed-world assumption and adopt discriminative
training objectives, which limits their reasoning capacity during completion.
Recent generative completion approaches powered by advanced large language
models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning abilities in unimodal knowledge graph
completion, but their potential in MMKGC remains largely unexplored. To bridge
this gap, we propose HERGC, a Heterogeneous Experts Representation and
Generative Completion framework for MMKGs. HERGC first deploys a Heterogeneous
Experts Representation Retriever that enriches and fuses multimodal information
and retrieves a compact candidate set for each incomplete triple. It then uses
a Generative LLM Predictor fine-tuned on minimal instruction data to accurately
identify the correct answer from these candidates. Extensive experiments on
three standard MMKG benchmarks demonstrate HERGC's effectiveness and
robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 不同方法在不同模型上效果差异显著，例如MeLLo在GPT-4O-MINI上准确率为39.47，而在QWEN2.5-3B上仅为3.83。

Conclusion: COMPKE填补了现有基准的不足，揭示了知识编辑方法在复杂推理场景中的局限性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Knowledge Editing, which efficiently modifies the knowledge in large language
models, has gathered great attention. Current benchmarks primarily use
multi-hop question answering to assess and analyze newly injected or updated
knowledge. However, we argue that these benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate
how well the updated models apply this knowledge in real-life scenarios,
particularly when questions require complex reasoning, involving one-to-many
relationships or multi-step logical intersections. To fill in this gap, we
introduce a new benchmark, COMPKE: Complex Question Answering under Knowledge
Editing, which includes 11,924 complex questions that reflect real-life
situations. We conduct an extensive evaluation of four knowledge editing
methods on COMPKE, revealing that their effectiveness varies notably across
different models. For instance, MeLLo attains an accuracy of 39.47 on
GPT-4O-MINI, but this drops sharply to 3.83 on QWEN2.5-3B. We further
investigate the underlying causes of these disparities from both methodological
and model-specific perspectives. The datasets are available at

Conclusion: CoRE是一种无需训练且持续的方法，显著提升LLMs在结构化数据上的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on plain text tasks
but underperform on structured data like tables and databases. Potential
challenges arise from their underexposure during pre-training and rigid
text-to-structure transfer mechanisms. Unlike humans who seamlessly apply
learned patterns across data modalities, LLMs struggle to infer implicit
relationships embedded in tabular formats, especially in the absence of
explicit structural guidance. To bridge this cognitive gap, we introduce
Contrastive Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Experience (CoRE), a framework
that builds experience memory representations and enhances generalization
through contrastive In-Context Learning (ICL) to simulate human-like knowledge
transfer. Experiments on Text-to-SQL and TableQA show CoRE significantly
improves performance, achieving average gains of 3.44% and 4.24%, with up to
17.2% on challenging tasks. Our Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-generated
Experience Memory expands training data 8-9x, enhancing diversity and domain
coverage. This training-free and continual method propels LLMs toward
structured knowledge expertise.

TL;DR: EEG2TEXT-CN是一个针对中文的开源EEG到文本生成框架，结合生物启发的EEG编码器和预训练语言模型，通过掩码预训练和对比学习实现脑信号与语言对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索非语音、跨模态的脑信号解码，为中文认知语言接口研究奠定基础。

Method: 使用NICE-EEG编码器和MiniLM语言模型，通过掩码预训练和对比学习对齐脑信号与语言表示，支持零样本句子生成。

Result: 在1500个训练验证句子和300个测试样本上，BLEU-1得分为6.38%，显示词汇对齐潜力，但句法流畅性仍需改进。

Conclusion: EEG2TEXT-CN展示了从EEG解码中文文本的可行性，为多语言脑文本研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We propose EEG2TEXT-CN, which, to the best of our knowledge, represents one
of the earliest open-vocabulary EEG-to-text generation frameworks tailored for
Chinese. Built on a biologically grounded EEG encoder (NICE-EEG) and a compact
pretrained language model (MiniLM), our architecture aligns multichannel brain
signals with natural language representations via masked pretraining and
contrastive learning. Using a subset of the ChineseEEG dataset, where each
sentence contains approximately ten Chinese characters aligned with 128-channel
EEG recorded at 256 Hz, we segment EEG into per-character embeddings and
predict full sentences in a zero-shot setting. The decoder is trained with
teacher forcing and padding masks to accommodate variable-length sequences.
Evaluation on over 1,500 training-validation sentences and 300 held-out test
samples shows promising lexical alignment, with a best BLEU-1 score of 6.38\%.
While syntactic fluency remains a challenge, our findings demonstrate the
feasibility of non-phonetic, cross-modal language decoding from EEG. This work
opens a new direction in multilingual brain-to-text research and lays the
foundation for future cognitive-language interfaces in Chinese.

TL;DR: 论文通过信息瓶颈（IB）原理解释了双向语言模型优于单向模型的原因，并提出FlowNIB方法动态估计互信息，验证了双向模型在信息保留和表示复杂性上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨双向语言模型在自然语言理解任务中优于单向模型的理论原因。

Method: 提出FlowNIB方法，动态估计训练中的互信息，解决传统IB方法的计算难题和固定权衡问题。

Result: 理论证明双向模型保留更多互信息且具有更高有效维度；实验验证了信息编码和压缩的动态过程。

Conclusion: 为双向架构的有效性提供了理论解释，并提出了分析深度语言模型中信息流的实用工具。

Abstract: Bidirectional language models have better context understanding and perform
better than unidirectional models on natural language understanding tasks, yet
the theoretical reasons behind this advantage remain unclear. In this work, we
investigate this disparity through the lens of the Information Bottleneck (IB)
principle, which formalizes a trade-off between compressing input information
and preserving task-relevant content. We propose FlowNIB, a dynamic and
scalable method for estimating mutual information during training that
addresses key limitations of classical IB approaches, including computational
intractability and fixed trade-off schedules. Theoretically, we show that
bidirectional models retain more mutual information and exhibit higher
effective dimensionality than unidirectional models. To support this, we
present a generalized framework for measuring representational complexity and
prove that bidirectional representations are strictly more informative under
mild conditions. We further validate our findings through extensive experiments
across multiple models and tasks using FlowNIB, revealing how information is
encoded and compressed throughout training. Together, our work provides a
principled explanation for the effectiveness of bidirectional architectures and
introduces a practical tool for analyzing information flow in deep language
models.

*Nidhi Kowtal,Raviraj Joshi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出L3Cube-MahaEmotions数据集，用于低资源语言马拉地语的情感识别，通过合成标注和人工标注结合的方式构建，并评估了GPT-4和BERT模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如马拉地语）情感识别中标注数据不足的问题。

Method: 使用LLM（GPT-4和Llama3-405B）进行合成标注，人工标注验证和测试集，采用Chain-of-Translation提示技术。

Result: GPT-4在情感识别任务中表现优于微调BERT模型，但BERT模型在合成标签上训练效果不佳。

Conclusion: 高质量人工标注数据对情感识别至关重要，通用LLM在低资源任务中表现优于专用模型。

Abstract: Emotion recognition in low-resource languages like Marathi remains
challenging due to limited annotated data. We present L3Cube-MahaEmotions, a
high-quality Marathi emotion recognition dataset with 11 fine-grained emotion
labels. The training data is synthetically annotated using large language
models (LLMs), while the validation and test sets are manually labeled to serve
as a reliable gold-standard benchmark. Building on the MahaSent dataset, we
apply the Chain-of-Translation (CoTR) prompting technique, where Marathi
sentences are translated into English and emotion labeled via a single prompt.
GPT-4 and Llama3-405B were evaluated, with GPT-4 selected for training data
annotation due to superior label quality. We evaluate model performance using
standard metrics and explore label aggregation strategies (e.g., Union,
Intersection). While GPT-4 predictions outperform fine-tuned BERT models,
BERT-based models trained on synthetic labels fail to surpass GPT-4. This
highlights both the importance of high-quality human-labeled data and the
inherent complexity of emotion recognition. An important finding of this work
is that generic LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama3-405B generalize better than
fine-tuned BERT for complex low-resource emotion recognition tasks. The dataset
and model are shared publicly at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/MarathiNLP

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了两个新基准VQA-Causal和VCR-Causal，专门用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）的因果推理能力，发现VLMs在因果推理任务上表现不佳，并探讨了通过微调策略改进的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在下游任务中表现优异，但其对视觉输入中因果关系的理解和推理能力尚不明确，现有基准难以真正评估其因果推理能力。

Method: 设计了VQA-Causal和VCR-Causal两个新基准，用于隔离和严格评估VLMs的因果推理能力，并通过微调策略进行改进。

Result: VLMs在对象和活动识别上表现优异，但在因果推理任务上表现较差，仅略高于随机猜测。分析表明，训练数据中缺乏明确的因果关系表达是主要原因。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前VLMs在因果推理上的关键不足，为未来改进因果理解能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of vision-language models (VLMs) on
downstream tasks, their ability to understand and reason about causal
relationships in visual inputs remains unclear. Robust causal reasoning is
fundamental to solving complex high-level reasoning tasks, yet existing
benchmarks often include a mixture of reasoning questions, and VLMs can
frequently exploit object recognition and activity identification as shortcuts
to arrive at the correct answers, making it challenging to truly assess their
causal reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce VQA-Causal and
VCR-Causal, two new benchmarks specifically designed to isolate and rigorously
evaluate VLMs' causal reasoning abilities. Our findings reveal that while VLMs
excel in object and activity recognition, they perform poorly on causal
reasoning tasks, often only marginally surpassing random guessing. Further
analysis suggests that this limitation stems from a severe lack of causal
expressions in widely used training datasets, where causal relationships are
rarely explicitly conveyed. We additionally explore fine-tuning strategies with
hard negative cases, showing that targeted fine-tuning can improve model's
causal reasoning while maintaining generalization and downstream performance.
Our study highlights a key gap in current VLMs and lays the groundwork for
future work on causal understanding.

TL;DR: CC-Tuning提出了一种新的多语言微调范式，通过在潜在层面建立跨语言连接机制，显著提升了大型语言模型的多语言能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的多语言能力不平衡，主要源于英语中心的训练语料。现有方法在数据层面进行微调，忽略了潜在层面的跨语言交互潜力。

Method: CC-Tuning在训练中融合英语和非英语输入的激活，并通过可训练的决策器识别有益激活；在推理时使用变换矩阵模拟跨语言连接。

Result: 在涵盖22种语言的六个基准测试中，CC-Tuning优于传统微调方法，并展示了潜在层面跨语言交互的潜力。

Conclusion: CC-Tuning为提升LLMs的多语言性能提供了实用且有效的潜在层面解决方案。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) often exhibit imbalanced multilingual
capabilities due to their English-centric training corpora. To address this,
existing fine-tuning approaches operating at the data-level (e.g., through data
augmentation or distillation) typically introduce implicit cross-lingual
alignment, overlooking the potential for more profound, latent-level
cross-lingual interactions. In this work, we propose CC-Tuning, a novel
multilingual fine-tuning paradigm that explicitly establishes a cross-lingual
connection mechanism at the latent level. During training, CC-Tuning fuses the
feed forward activations from both English and non-English inputs, enabling the
model to benefit from both linguistic resources. This process is facilitated
with a trainable Decision Maker that identifies beneficial activations.
Furthermore, during inference, a Transform Matrix is utilized to simulate the
cross-lingual connection under monolingual setting through representation
transformation. Our experiments on six benchmarks covering 22 languages show
that CC-Tuning outperforms vanilla SFT and offers a strong latent-level
alternative to data-level augmentation methods. Further analysis also
highlights the practicality of CC-Tuning and the potential of latent-level
cross-lingual interactions in advancing the multilingual performance of LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出选择性遗忘（SU）方法，仅针对目标文档中与不需要信息相关的关键子集进行遗忘，而非所有标记，从而有效保留模型的通用知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统遗忘方法会无差别地更新模型参数以遗忘目标文档中的所有标记，包括携带通用知识的常见标记（如代词、介词等），这可能导致模型性能下降。

Method: 提出选择性遗忘（SU）方法，通过识别目标遗忘集中与不需要信息相关的关键子集，仅对这些标记进行遗忘。

Result: 在两个基准测试和六种基线遗忘算法上的实验表明，SU不仅能有效遗忘目标数据，还能显著保留模型在保留集上的性能。

Conclusion: 选择性遗忘（SU）是一种更高效的遗忘方法，能够在遗忘不需要信息的同时保留模型的通用知识。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning has recently gained significant
attention, driven by the need to remove unwanted information, such as private,
sensitive, or copyrighted content, from LLMs. However, conventional unlearning
approaches indiscriminately update model parameters to forget all tokens in a
target document, including common tokens (e.g., pronouns, prepositions, general
nouns) that carry general knowledge. In this paper, we highlight that not every
token needs forgetting. We propose Selective Unlearning (SU), which identifies
a critical subset of tokens within the forgetting set that is relevant to the
unwanted information, and unlearns only those tokens. Experiments on two
benchmarks and six baseline unlearning algorithms demonstrate that SU not only
achieves effective unlearning on the targeted forget data, but also
significantly preserves the model's utility in the retaining set.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MLLM Interview（MITV）的策略，通过少量问题快速评估多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLLM评估方法在大规模数据上进行全覆盖问答测试资源消耗大且耗时，因此需要一种更高效的评估方法。

Method: 首先构建了一个带有难度标签的面试数据集，然后提出MITV策略，通过少量问题初步评估模型性能，并逐步测试其极限。

Result: 实验表明，MITV策略在MLLM基准数据集上表现良好，能通过少量问答快速获得模型评估能力。

Conclusion: MITV策略为MLLM性能评估提供了一种高效且资源节约的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) has led to a
wide range of MLLM applications, and a number of benchmark datasets have sprung
up in order to assess MLLM abilities. However, full-coverage Q&A testing on
large-scale data is resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address this
issue, we propose the MLLM Interview (MITV) strategy, which aims to quickly
obtain MLLM performance metrics by quizzing fewer question. First, First, we
constructed the interview dataset, which was built on an existing MLLM
assessment dataset, by adding difficulty labels based on the performance of
some typical MLLMs in this dataset. Second, we propose an MLLM Interview
strategy, which obtains an initial performance situation of the large model by
quizzing a small number of topics and then continuously tries to test the
model's limits. Through extensive experiments, the result shows that the MITV
strategy proposed in this paper performs well on MLLM benchmark datasets, and
it is able to obtain the model evaluation capability faster through a small
number of questions and answers.

TL;DR: 论文提出了A4Bench基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在感知环境动作可能性（affordance）方面的能力，发现现有模型表现远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MLLMs在感知环境动作可能性方面的能力，填补其在直观和安全交互中的研究空白。

Method: 通过A4Bench基准，从构成性affordance和转化性affordance两个维度评估17种MLLMs的表现。

Result: 专有模型优于开源模型，但所有模型表现有限，尤其在转化性affordance感知上差距显著，最佳模型准确率仅18.05%，远低于人类水平（81.25%-85.34%）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了MLLMs在环境理解上的关键不足，为未来开发更鲁棒、上下文感知的AI系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Affordance theory posits that environments inherently offer action
possibilities that shape perception and behavior. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks, their ability to
perceive affordance, which is crucial for intuitive and safe interactions,
remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce A4Bench, a novel benchmark
designed to evaluate the affordance perception abilities of MLLMs across two
dimensions: 1) Constitutive Affordance}, assessing understanding of inherent
object properties through 1,282 question-answer pairs spanning nine
sub-disciplines, and 2) Transformative Affordance, probing dynamic and
contextual nuances (e.g., misleading, time-dependent, cultural, or
individual-specific affordance) with 718 challenging question-answer pairs.
Evaluating 17 MLLMs (nine proprietary and eight open-source) against human
performance, we find that proprietary models generally outperform open-source
counterparts, but all exhibit limited capabilities, particularly in
transformative affordance perception. Furthermore, even top-performing models,
such as Gemini-2.0-Pro (18.05% overall exact match accuracy), significantly lag
behind human performance (best: 85.34%, worst: 81.25%). These findings
highlight critical gaps in environmental understanding of MLLMs and provide a
foundation for advancing AI systems toward more robust, context-aware
interactions. The dataset is available in

Motivation: 评估LLMs的社交智能及其与人类的差异，填补现有工作在结果导向和过程导向评估上的空白。

Method: 提出SocialEval评测框架，通过手工构建叙事脚本（世界树结构）评估LLMs的社交能力。

Result: 实验显示LLMs在SI上落后人类，但表现出亲社会性和偏好积极行为，其表征空间和神经元激活模式类似人脑功能分区。

Conclusion: LLMs在社交智能上与人类存在差距，但已发展出类似人脑的能力特定功能分区。

Abstract: LLMs exhibit promising Social Intelligence (SI) in modeling human behavior,
raising the need to evaluate LLMs' SI and their discrepancy with humans. SI
equips humans with interpersonal abilities to behave wisely in navigating
social interactions to achieve social goals. This presents an operational
evaluation paradigm: outcome-oriented goal achievement evaluation and
process-oriented interpersonal ability evaluation, which existing work fails to
address. To this end, we propose SocialEval, a script-based bilingual SI
benchmark, integrating outcome- and process-oriented evaluation by manually
crafting narrative scripts. Each script is structured as a world tree that
contains plot lines driven by interpersonal ability, providing a comprehensive
view of how LLMs navigate social interactions. Experiments show that LLMs fall
behind humans on both SI evaluations, exhibit prosociality, and prefer more
positive social behaviors, even if they lead to goal failure. Analysis of LLMs'
formed representation space and neuronal activations reveals that LLMs have
developed ability-specific functional partitions akin to the human brain.

Method: Pi-SQL首先生成提供细粒度步骤指导的Python程序，再根据其指导生成SQL程序，并通过候选策略选择最优结果。

Result: Pi-SQL的执行准确率比最佳基线高3.20，效率评分高4.55。

Conclusion: Pi-SQL通过Python程序作为中间层，有效缩小了语义鸿沟，显著提升了SQL生成的性能。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL transforms the user queries from natural language to executable
SQL programs, enabling non-experts to interact with complex databases. Existing
prompt-based methods craft meticulous text guidelines and examples to
facilitate SQL generation, but their accuracy is hindered by the large semantic
gap between the texts and the low-resource SQL programs. In this work, we
propose Pi-SQL, which incorporates the high-resource Python program as a pivot
to bridge between the natural language query and SQL program. In particular,
Pi-SQL first generates Python programs that provide fine-grained step-by-step
guidelines in their code blocks or comments, and then produces an SQL program
following the guidance of each Python program.The final SQL program matches the
reference Python program's query results and, through selection from candidates
generated by different strategies, achieves superior execution speed, with a
reward-based valid efficiency score up to 4.55 higher than the best-performing
baseline.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Pi-SQL, which
improves the execution accuracy of the best-performing baseline by up to 3.20.

Motivation: 探讨Transformer模型如何表示复合词及其组合性，填补现有研究的空白。

Result: 岭回归模型表现最佳，经典向量加法模型接近最优，大多数嵌入模型组合性高，BERT表现较差。

Conclusion: 研究全面分析了组合性，为模型设计和评估提供了新见解。

Abstract: Compositionality is a key aspect of human intelligence, essential for
reasoning and generalization. While transformer-based models have become the de
facto standard for many language modeling tasks, little is known about how they
represent compound words, and whether these representations are compositional.
In this study, we test compositionality in Mistral, OpenAI Large, and Google
embedding models, and compare them with BERT. First, we evaluate
compositionality in the representations by examining six diverse models of
compositionality (addition, multiplication, dilation, regression, etc.). We
find that ridge regression, albeit linear, best accounts for compositionality.
Surprisingly, we find that the classic vector addition model performs almost as
well as any other model. Next, we verify that most embedding models are highly
compositional, while BERT shows much poorer compositionality. We verify and
visualize our findings with a synthetic dataset consisting of fully transparent
adjective-noun compositions. Overall, we present a thorough investigation of
compositionality.

Motivation: 现有ECG-focused MLLMs主要局限于单一12导联、短时程ECG输入的报告生成任务，未能充分发挥MLLMs的潜力。

Method: 构建anyECG数据集，涵盖多种任务和ECG输入类型；提出anyECG-chat模型，支持动态长度和多ECG输入，采用三阶段课程训练方法。

Result: anyECG-chat能够支持多种实际应用场景，包括报告生成、长时程少导联ECG异常波形定位及多ECG综合分析。

Conclusion: anyECG-chat和anyECG数据集为ECG分析提供了更灵活和全面的解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has sparked interest
in their application to electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. However, existing
ECG-focused MLLMs primarily focus on report generation tasks, often limited to
single 12-lead, short-duration (10s) ECG inputs, thereby underutilizing the
potential of MLLMs. To this end, we aim to develop a MLLM for ECG analysis that
supports a broader range of tasks and more flexible ECG inputs. However,
existing ECG-QA datasets are often monotonous. To address this gap, we first
constructed the anyECG dataset, which encompasses a wide variety of tasks,
including report generation, abnormal waveform localization, and open-ended
question answering. In addition to standard hospital ECGs, we introduced
long-duration reduced-lead ECGs for home environments and multiple ECG
comparison scenarios commonly encountered in clinical practice. Furthermore, we
propose the anyECG-chat model, which supports dynamic-length ECG inputs and
multiple ECG inputs. We trained the model using a three-stage curriculum
training recipe with the anyECG dataset. A comprehensive evaluation was
conducted, demonstrating that anyECG-chat is capable of supporting various
practical application scenarios, including not only common report generation
tasks but also abnormal waveform localization for long-duration reduced-lead
ECGs in home environments and comprehensive comparative analysis of multiple
ECGs.

Motivation: 讽刺检测在语音中因数据稀缺和多模态依赖而受限，需开发仅依赖语音的解决方案。

Method: 使用GPT-4o和LLaMA 3进行初始标注，人类验证解决分歧，并通过协作门控架构验证标注质量和检测性能。

Result: 创建的PodSarc数据集在讽刺检测任务中表现优异（F1分数73.63%）。

Conclusion: 提出的标注流程和PodSarc数据集为讽刺语音检测研究提供了有效工具和基准。

Abstract: Sarcasm fundamentally alters meaning through tone and context, yet detecting
it in speech remains a challenge due to data scarcity. In addition, existing
detection systems often rely on multimodal data, limiting their applicability
in contexts where only speech is available. To address this, we propose an
annotation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate a
sarcasm dataset. Using a publicly available sarcasm-focused podcast, we employ
GPT-4o and LLaMA 3 for initial sarcasm annotations, followed by human
verification to resolve disagreements. We validate this approach by comparing
annotation quality and detection performance on a publicly available sarcasm
dataset using a collaborative gating architecture. Finally, we introduce
PodSarc, a large-scale sarcastic speech dataset created through this pipeline.
The detection model achieves a 73.63% F1 score, demonstrating the dataset's
potential as a benchmark for sarcasm detection research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法生成的数学问题仅关注文本质量，忽视教育目标，且无法满足复杂多维需求。

Method: 提出EQPR方法，采用“计划-评估-优化”流程，结合蒙特卡洛树搜索和大型语言模型进行迭代优化。

Result: 实验表明，EQPR在多维度教育目标的问题生成上表现显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: EQPR能有效生成符合教育目标的高质量数学问题，为教育技术提供了新思路。

Abstract: Automatically generating high-quality mathematical problems that align with
educational objectives is a crucial task in NLP-based educational technology.
Traditional generation methods focus primarily on textual quality, but they
often overlook educational objectives. Moreover, these methods address only
single-dimensional, simple question generation, failing to meet complex,
multifaceted educational requirements. To address these challenges, we
constructed and annotated EduMath, a dataset of 16k mathematical questions with
multi-dimensional educational objectives. Based on this dataset, we developed
EQGEVAL, which incorporates three evaluation dimensions and is designed to
assess the ability of models to generate educational questions. Drawing
inspiration from teachers' problem design processes, we propose the Educational
Question Planning with self-Reflection (EQPR) method for educational
mathematical question generation, following a "plan-evaluate-optimize"
approach. Specifically, by combining planning algorithm based on Monte Carlo
Tree Search with the generative capabilities of Large Language Models, we
continuously optimize questions through iterative feedback. This
self-optimization mechanism ensures that the generated questions both fit the
educational context and strategically achieve specific basic educational
objectives. Through extensive experiments based on EQGEVAL, we have
demonstrated that EQPR achieves significant improvements in generating

*Dren Fazlija,Arkadij Orlov,Sandipan Sikdar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出敏感性感知（SA）概念，帮助大语言模型（LLMs）遵守访问权限规则，并开发了评估工具ACCESS DENIED INC。实验显示模型在管理未授权请求时行为差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在企业数据管理中因信息敏感性及访问限制带来的隐私和性能挑战。

Method: 提出敏感性感知（SA）概念，并开发评估环境ACCESS DENIED INC。

Result: 实验发现模型在处理未授权请求时行为差异显著，但能有效处理合法查询。

Conclusion: 为敏感性感知语言模型奠定基准，并为隐私导向的AI系统提供改进方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly becoming valuable to corporate
data management due to their ability to process text from various document
formats and facilitate user interactions through natural language queries.
However, LLMs must consider the sensitivity of information when communicating
with employees, especially given access restrictions. Simple filtering based on
user clearance levels can pose both performance and privacy challenges. To
address this, we propose the concept of sensitivity awareness (SA), which
enables LLMs to adhere to predefined access rights rules. In addition, we
developed a benchmarking environment called ACCESS DENIED INC to evaluate SA.
Our experimental findings reveal significant variations in model behavior,
particularly in managing unauthorized data requests while effectively
addressing legitimate queries. This work establishes a foundation for
benchmarking sensitivity-aware language models and provides insights to enhance
privacy-centric AI systems in corporate environments.

*Vadivel Abishethvarman,Bhavik Chandna,Pratik Jalan,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XGUARD是一个评估框架，用于量化LLM生成的极端内容的风险等级，提供更细致的分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全评估过于简化，无法捕捉LLM生成内容的复杂风险。

Method: 开发XGUARD基准，包含3,840个提示，将响应分为5个危险等级，并引入攻击严重性曲线（ASC）。

Result: 评估了6个LLM和2种防御策略，揭示了安全漏洞与表达自由之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 分级安全指标对构建可信LLM至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate content spanning ideological
rhetoric to explicit instructions for violence. However, existing safety
evaluations often rely on simplistic binary labels (safe and unsafe),
overlooking the nuanced spectrum of risk these outputs pose. To address this,
we present XGUARD, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to assess the
severity of extremist content generated by LLMs. XGUARD includes 3,840 red
teaming prompts sourced from real world data such as social media and news,
covering a broad range of ideologically charged scenarios. Our framework
categorizes model responses into five danger levels (0 to 4), enabling a more
nuanced analysis of both the frequency and severity of failures. We introduce
the interpretable Attack Severity Curve (ASC) to visualize vulnerabilities and
compare defense mechanisms across threat intensities. Using XGUARD, we evaluate
six popular LLMs and two lightweight defense strategies, revealing key insights
into current safety gaps and trade-offs between robustness and expressive
freedom. Our work underscores the value of graded safety metrics for building
trustworthy LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的生成建模范式NTPP，利用双通道语音数据提升语音语言模型的对话能力，显著改善了响应连贯性和自然度，同时降低了推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受GPT-4o启发，研究者希望提升语音语言模型（SLMs）的自然对话能力，但目前方法未充分利用双通道语音数据的潜力。

Method: 引入Next-Token-Pair Prediction（NTPP）方法，首次在解码器架构中实现说话者无关的双通道对话学习。

Result: NTPP在标准测试中显著提升了SLMs的对话能力（如轮转预测、响应连贯性和自然度），并降低了推理延迟。

Conclusion: NTPP为语音语言模型的双通道对话学习提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive capabilities of GPT-4o, there is growing interest
in enabling speech language models (SLMs) to engage in natural, fluid spoken
interactions with humans. Recent advancements have led to the development of
several SLMs that demonstrate promising results in this area. However, current
approaches have yet to fully exploit dual-channel speech data, which inherently
captures the structure and dynamics of human conversation. In this work, we
systematically explore the use of dual-channel speech data in the context of
modern large language models, and introduce a novel generative modeling
paradigm, Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP), to enable speaker-independent
dual-channel spoken dialogue learning using decoder-only architectures for the
first time. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks, and empirical
results show that our proposed method, NTPP, significantly improves the
conversational abilities of SLMs in terms of turn-taking prediction, response
coherence, and naturalness. Moreover, compared to existing methods, NTPP
achieves substantially lower inference latency, highlighting its practical
efficiency for real-time applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LEMONADE是一个大规模多语言冲突事件数据集，基于ACLED数据，采用抽象事件提取（AEE）和实体链接（AEL）方法，评估了多种LLM模型，并提出了零样本检索系统ZEST。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言来源的全球事件分析挑战，提升事件提取和实体链接的跨语言性能。

Method: 引入AEE和AEL任务，评估LLM模型，提出ZEST零样本系统。

Result: 最佳零样本系统F1得分为58.3%，ZEST在AEL任务中F1为45.7%，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 零样本方法仍有改进空间，需进一步研究以缩小与监督系统的差距。

Abstract: This paper presents LEMONADE, a large-scale conflict event dataset comprising
39,786 events across 20 languages and 171 countries, with extensive coverage of
region-specific entities. LEMONADE is based on a partially reannotated subset
of the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), which has documented
global conflict events for over a decade.
  To address the challenge of aggregating multilingual sources for global event
analysis, we introduce abstractive event extraction (AEE) and its subtask,
abstractive entity linking (AEL). Unlike conventional span-based event
extraction, our approach detects event arguments and entities through holistic
document understanding and normalizes them across the multilingual dataset. We
evaluate various large language models (LLMs) on these tasks, adapt existing
zero-shot event extraction systems, and benchmark supervised models.
Additionally, we introduce ZEST, a novel zero-shot retrieval-based system for
AEL.
  Our best zero-shot system achieves an end-to-end F1 score of 58.3%, with LLMs
outperforming specialized event extraction models such as GoLLIE. For entity
linking, ZEST achieves an F1 score of 45.7%, significantly surpassing OneNet, a
state-of-the-art zero-shot baseline that achieves only 23.7%. However, these
zero-shot results lag behind the best supervised systems by 20.1% and 37.0% in
the end-to-end and AEL tasks, respectively, highlighting the need for further
research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨自监督模型学习的语音表征是否具有语言特异性，发现荷兰语预训练能更好地编码荷兰语的语言特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究预训练语言对自监督模型学习语言特征的影响，尤其是荷兰语的语音和词汇信息。

Method: 测试Wav2Vec2模型内部表征对荷兰语特征的编码能力，比较荷兰语、英语及多语言预训练的效果。

Result: 荷兰语预训练显著提升荷兰语特征的编码能力，且与自动语音识别任务表现相关。

Conclusion: 语言特异性预训练能优化模型对目标语言特征的编码能力，并提升下游任务表现。

Abstract: How language-specific are speech representations learned by self-supervised
models? Existing work has shown that a range of linguistic features can be
successfully decoded from end-to-end models trained only on speech recordings.
However, it's less clear to what extent pre-training on specific languages
improves language-specific linguistic information. Here we test the encoding of
Dutch phonetic and lexical information in internal representations of
self-supervised Wav2Vec2 models. Pre-training exclusively on Dutch improves the
representation of Dutch linguistic features as compared to pre-training on
similar amounts of English or larger amounts of multilingual data. This
language-specific advantage is well-detected by trained clustering or
classification probes, and partially observable using zero-shot metrics.
Furthermore, the language-specific benefit on linguistic feature encoding
aligns with downstream performance on Automatic Speech Recognition.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的新方法，用于分析和聚类日记写作的目的，并在苏联时期的日记数据上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理大规模日记数据时效果不佳，因此需要一种更有效的方法来提取和分析日记写作的目的。

Method: 采用多种LLM（包括GPT-4o和o1-mini）对日记数据进行目的识别和聚类，并与模板基线方法进行比较。

Result: GPT-4o和o1-mini表现最佳，模板方法效果较差。研究还分析了作者性别、年龄和写作年份对目的的影响，并探讨了模型的错误类型。

Conclusion: LLM在日记分析中表现出潜力，但仍需改进，未来研究可进一步优化模型性能。

Abstract: Diary analysis presents challenges, particularly in extracting meaningful
information from large corpora, where traditional methods often fail to deliver
satisfactory results. This study introduces a novel method based on Large
Language Models (LLMs) to identify and cluster the various purposes of diary
writing. By "purposes," we refer to the intentions behind diary writing, such
as documenting life events, self-reflection, or practicing language skills. Our
approach is applied to Soviet-era diaries (1922-1929) from the Prozhito digital
archive, a rich collection of personal narratives. We evaluate different
proprietary and open-source LLMs, finding that GPT-4o and o1-mini achieve the
best performance, while a template-based baseline is significantly less
effective. Additionally, we analyze the retrieved purposes based on gender, age
of the authors, and the year of writing. Furthermore, we examine the types of
errors made by the models, providing a deeper understanding of their
limitations and potential areas for improvement in future research.

Abstract: Access to humanities research databases is often hindered by the limitations
of traditional interaction formats, particularly in the methods of searching
and response generation. This study introduces an LLM-based smart assistant
designed to facilitate natural language communication with digital humanities
data. The assistant, developed in a chatbot format, leverages the RAG approach
and integrates state-of-the-art technologies such as hybrid search, automatic
query generation, text-to-SQL filtering, semantic database search, and
hyperlink insertion. To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, experiments
were conducted to assess the response quality of various language models. The
testing was based on the Prozhito digital archive, which contains diary entries
from predominantly Russian-speaking individuals who lived in the 20th century.
The chatbot is tailored to support anthropology and history researchers, as
well as non-specialist users with an interest in the field, without requiring
prior technical training. By enabling researchers to query complex databases
with natural language, this tool aims to enhance accessibility and efficiency
in humanities research. The study highlights the potential of Large Language
Models to transform the way researchers and the public interact with digital
archives, making them more intuitive and inclusive. Additional materials are

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) remains
a challenging and complex endeavor. Even fundamental questions, such as how
fine-tuning affects model behavior, often require extensive empirical
evaluation. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective based on the
geometric properties of contextual latent embeddings to study the effects of
training and fine-tuning. To that end, we measure the local dimensions of a
contextual language model's latent space and analyze their shifts during
training and fine-tuning. We show that the local dimensions provide insights
into the model's training dynamics and generalization ability. Specifically,
the mean of the local dimensions predicts when the model's training
capabilities are exhausted, as exemplified in a dialogue state tracking task,
overfitting, as demonstrated in an emotion recognition task, and grokking, as
illustrated with an arithmetic task. Furthermore, our experiments suggest a
practical heuristic: reductions in the mean local dimension tend to accompany
and predict subsequent performance gains. Through this exploration, we aim to
provide practitioners with a deeper understanding of the implications of
fine-tuning on embedding spaces, facilitating informed decisions when
configuring models for specific applications. The results of this work
contribute to the ongoing discourse on the interpretability, adaptability, and
generalizability of LLMs by bridging the gap between intrinsic model mechanisms
and geometric properties in the respective embeddings.

### [130] [Probing Neural Topology of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01042)
*Yu Zheng,Yuan Yuan,Yong Li,Paolo Santi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“graph probing”的方法，用于揭示大语言模型（LLM）神经元的功能连接拓扑结构，并将其与语言生成性能关联。研究发现，神经拓扑结构可以普遍预测下一个词的预测性能，且这种预测性在仅保留1%的神经元连接或模型仅经过8次预训练步骤时仍保持稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对LLM的神经元表示与可解释语义的关联已有研究，但神经元如何通过功能协同激活以产生涌现能力仍不清楚，这阻碍了对LLM的深入理解和安全开发。

Method: 论文引入了“graph probing”方法，通过分析不同LLM家族和规模的内部神经图，揭示其功能连接拓扑结构。

Result: 研究发现神经拓扑结构可以普遍预测语言生成性能，且这种预测性具有稀疏性和早期涌现的特点。不同LLM尽管在架构、参数和训练数据上有显著差异，但会发展出复杂且一致的神经拓扑结构。

Conclusion: 神经拓扑结构可能是LLM语言生成能力的基础，研究为理解和开发更安全的LLM提供了新视角。

Abstract: Probing large language models (LLMs) has yielded valuable insights into their
internal mechanisms by linking neural representations to interpretable
semantics. However, how neurons functionally co-activate with each other to
give rise to emergent capabilities remains largely unknown, hindering a deeper
understanding and safer development of LLMs. In this work, we introduce graph
probing, a method for uncovering the functional connectivity topology of LLM
neurons and relating it to language generation performance. By analyzing
internal neural graphs across diverse LLM families and scales, we discover a
universal predictability of next-token prediction performance using only neural
topology. This predictability is robust even when retaining just 1% of neuron
connections or probing models after only 8 pretraining steps, highlighting the
sparsity and early emergence of topological patterns. Further graph matching
analysis suggests that, despite significant distinctions in architectures,
parameters, and training data, different LLMs develop intricate and consistent
neural topological structures that may form the foundation for their language
generation abilities. Codes and data for the graph probing toolbox are released
at https://github.com/DavyMorgan/llm-graph-probing.

Motivation: 情感通过身体反应体现，但文本中此类情感的研究较少，因此需要扩展数据集并改进识别方法。

Method: 使用自动最佳-最差缩放和大型语言模型，结合简化提示指令和链式思维推理。

Result: 新方法在情感识别任务中表现优于监督方法，且小模型也能达到与大模型竞争的性能。

Abstract: Emotions manifest through physical experiences and bodily reactions, yet
identifying such embodied emotions in text remains understudied. We present an
embodied emotion classification dataset, CHEER-Ekman, extending the existing
binary embodied emotion dataset with Ekman's six basic emotion categories.
Using automatic best-worst scaling with large language models, we achieve
performance superior to supervised approaches on our new dataset. Our

chain-of-thought reasoning significantly improve emotion recognition accuracy,
enabling smaller models to achieve competitive performance with larger ones.

TL;DR: SealQA是一个新的基准测试，用于评估搜索增强语言模型在事实性问题上的表现，特别是在搜索结果冲突、嘈杂或无帮助的情况下。它包括三个版本：Seal-0（主要）、Seal-Hard和LongSeal，分别测试准确性、推理能力和长上下文多文档推理。当前前沿模型表现不佳，且增加计算资源并未显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有语言模型在事实性问题上的局限性，特别是在搜索结果不理想时的表现，SealQA旨在提供一个更具挑战性的评估基准。

Method: SealQA分为三个版本：Seal-0（最困难问题）、Seal-Hard（推理能力）和LongSeal（长上下文多文档推理）。通过测试前沿模型（如GPT-4.1、DeepSeek-R1-671B等）在这些任务上的表现，评估其能力。

Result: 前沿模型在SealQA上表现不佳，例如Seal-0的准确率仅为17.1%和6.3%。增加计算资源未显著提升性能，且模型对嘈杂搜索结果敏感。

Conclusion: SealQA揭示了当前语言模型在事实性问题上的局限性，为未来研究提供了新的挑战和方向。

Abstract: We introduce SealQA, a new challenge benchmark for evaluating
SEarch-Augmented Language models on fact-seeking questions where web search
yields conflicting, noisy, or unhelpful results. SealQA comes in three flavors:
(1) Seal-0 (main) and (2) Seal-Hard, which assess factual accuracy and
reasoning capabilities, with Seal-0 focusing on the most challenging questions
where chat models (e.g., GPT-4.1) typically achieve near-zero accuracy; and (3)
LongSeal, which extends SealQA to test long-context, multi-document reasoning
in "needle-in-a-haystack" settings. Our evaluation reveals critical limitations
in current models: Even frontier LLMs perform poorly across all SealQA flavors.
On Seal-0, frontier agentic models equipped with tools like o3 and o4-mini
achieve only 17.1% and 6.3% accuracy, respectively, at their best reasoning
efforts. We find that advanced reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1-671B and
o3-mini are highly vulnerable to noisy search results. Notably, increasing
test-time compute does not yield reliable gains across o3-mini, o4-mini, and
o3, with performance often plateauing or even declining early. Additionally,
while recent models are less affected by the "lost-in-the-middle" issue, they
still fail to reliably identify relevant documents in LongSeal when faced with
numerous distractors. To facilitate future work, we release SealQA at
huggingface.co/datasets/vtllms/sealqa.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在多编程语言与英语交互中的内部表示机制。

Method: 使用两个Llama模型对21种编程语言对进行少量样本翻译任务，解码中间层嵌入并分析神经元激活。

Result: 概念空间更接近英语，语言特定神经元集中在底层，而编程语言特有神经元出现在顶层。高度对齐的编程语言难以识别语言特定神经元。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLMs内部表示编程语言的结构模式，为理解模型概念空间提供了新视角。

Abstract: Several studies have explored the mechanisms of large language models (LLMs)
in coding tasks, but most have focused on programming languages (PLs) in a
monolingual setting. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between
multiple PLs and English in the concept space of LLMs. We perform a few-shot
translation task on 21 PL pairs using two Llama-based models. By decoding the
embeddings of intermediate layers during this task, we observe that the concept
space is closer to English (including PL keywords) and assigns high
probabilities to English tokens in the second half of the intermediate layers.
We analyze neuron activations for 11 PLs and English, finding that while
language-specific neurons are primarily concentrated in the bottom layers,
those exclusive to each PL tend to appear in the top layers. For PLs that are
highly aligned with multiple other PLs, identifying language-specific neurons
is not feasible. These PLs also tend to have a larger keyword set than other
PLs and are closer to the model's concept space regardless of the input/output
PL in the translation task. Our findings provide insights into how LLMs
internally represent PLs, revealing structural patterns in the model's concept
space. Code is available at https://github.com/cisnlp/code-specific-neurons.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: zip2zip是一个动态调整LLM词汇表的框架，通过减少生成的令牌数量提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态令牌化器在领域或语言特定输入上效率低，导致计算成本高。

Method: 基于LZW压缩的动态令牌化器、运行时嵌入层和因果语言建模变体。

Result: 输入输出序列长度减少20-60%，推理延迟显著改善。

Conclusion: zip2zip能高效适应动态词汇表，提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Tokenization efficiency plays a critical role in the performance and cost of
large language models (LLMs), yet most models rely on static tokenizers
optimized for general-purpose corpora. These tokenizers' fixed vocabularies
often fail to adapt to domain- or language-specific inputs, leading to longer
token sequences and higher computational costs. We introduce zip2zip, a
framework that enables LLMs to dynamically adjust token vocabulary at inference
time, allowing for fewer generated tokens and thus faster inference. zip2zip
consists of three key components: (1) a tokenizer based on Lempel-Ziv-Welch
(LZW) compression that incrementally compresses tokens into reusable
"hypertokens" on the fly; (2) an embedding layer that computes embeddings for
newly formed hypertokens at runtime; and (3) a causal language modeling variant
that trains the model to operate on hypertokenized, compressed sequences. We
show that an existing LLM can be zip2zip-fied in 10 GPU-hours via
parameter-efficient finetuning. The resulting zip2zip LLMs effectively learn to
use hypertokens at inference time, reducing input and output sequence length by
20-60\%, with significant improvements in inference latency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大语言模型（LLMs）在指代消解任务中处理指示词（如I、you、here、tomorrow）的表现，发现LLMs对部分指示词表现良好（如I），但对其他（如you、here、tomorrow）表现较差，并探讨了句法线索对性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究主要关注LLMs在名词和第三人称代词上的指代消解表现，而忽略了指示词的特殊挑战。本研究填补了这一空白。

Method: 研究构建了包含1600个多选题的英语指示词数据集，并评估了GPT-4o、Claude 3.5 Sonnet等主流LLMs的表现。

Result: LLMs对部分指示词（如I）表现优异，但对其他（如you、here、tomorrow）表现不佳，且句法线索对不同指示词的影响不一致。

Conclusion: LLMs在处理指示词时存在局限性，未来研究需进一步优化模型以应对此类挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performances in
tasks related to coreference resolution. However, previous studies mostly
assessed LLM performance on coreference resolution with nouns and third person
pronouns. This study evaluates LLM performance on coreference resolution with
indexical like I, you, here and tomorrow, which come with unique challenges due
to their linguistic properties. We present the first study examining how LLMs
interpret indexicals in English, releasing the English Indexical Dataset with
1600 multiple-choice questions. We evaluate pioneering LLMs, including GPT-4o,
Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and DeepSeek V3. Our results reveal that
LLMs exhibit an impressive performance with some indexicals (I), while
struggling with others (you, here, tomorrow), and that syntactic cues (e.g.
quotation) contribute to LLM performance with some indexicals, while they
reduce performance with others. Code and data are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在生成事实性不支持的回应时存在可信度问题，阻碍其广泛应用。

Method: RUL结合了判别性不可回答预测头和LLM生成核心，通过多阶段学习策略（包括监督微调和强化学习）实现。

Result: 实验显示RUL在不可回答检测和拒绝生成方面表现优异，同时保持对可回答问题的良好性能。

Conclusion: RUL显著提升了对话AI的可靠性和用户信任度，为更可靠的对话系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: The pervasive deployment of large language models (LLMs) in conversational AI
systems has revolutionized information access, yet their propensity for
generating factually unsupported or hallucinated responses remains a critical
impediment to trustworthiness and widespread adoption. This paper introduces
Reinforced Unanswerability Learning (RUL), a novel hybrid training paradigm
designed to imbue LLMs with the intrinsic capability to accurately detect
unanswerable questions and generate reliably appropriate responses. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on external classifiers or simple prompting,
RUL integrates a discriminative unanswerability prediction head with the LLM's
generative core, guided by a multi-stage learning strategy. This includes
supervised fine-tuning on a novel, richly annotated dataset,
Enhanced-CAsT-Answerability (ECA), which features hierarchical answerability
labels and ground-truth refusal responses. Crucially, RUL incorporates a
subsequent reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) phase to refine
the nuance, helpfulness, and informativeness of refusal responses. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RUL's superior performance, achieving significantly
higher accuracy in unanswerability detection across sentence, paragraph, and
ranking levels, and substantially increasing the generation of appropriate

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多模态模型（如语音和文本）是否能够形成更丰富的语义理解，并通过潜在概念分析方法进行了研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）展示了仅通过文本训练即可获得广泛知识和推理能力，这引发了关于其他模态（如语音）是否也能形成类似概念，以及多模态训练是否能增强语义理解的疑问。

Method: 使用潜在概念分析（Latent Concept Analysis）这一无监督方法，分析语音和文本模型单独及联合训练时的潜在表示。

Result: 研究发现多模态训练可能促进更结构化、更丰富的语义理解。

Conclusion: 论文为多模态模型的语义理解提供了实证支持，并公开了相关资源以促进可重复性。

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated that systems
trained solely on text can acquire extensive world knowledge, develop reasoning
capabilities, and internalize abstract semantic concepts--showcasing properties
that can be associated with general intelligence. This raises an intriguing
question: Do such concepts emerge in models trained on other modalities, such
as speech? Furthermore, when models are trained jointly on multiple modalities:
Do they develop a richer, more structured semantic understanding? To explore
this, we analyze the conceptual structures learned by speech and textual models
both individually and jointly. We employ Latent Concept Analysis, an
unsupervised method for uncovering and interpreting latent representations in
neural networks, to examine how semantic abstractions form across modalities.
For reproducibility we made scripts and other resources available to the
community.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于字符级嵌入的新型日志解析器，能够高效提取细粒度日志模板，在准确性和效率上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有日志解析器无法捕捉细粒度模板细节，导致下游任务准确性不足。

Method: 采用字符级嵌入和二进制编码序列的神经架构，实现细粒度日志模板提取。

Result: 在Loghub-2k和工业数据集上测试，准确性媲美LLM解析器，效率优于语义解析器。

Conclusion: 字符级日志解析器在低资源下表现优异，适用于需要高精度模板识别的任务。

Abstract: System-generated logs are typically converted into categorical log templates
through parsing. These templates are crucial for generating actionable insights
in various downstream tasks. However, existing parsers often fail to capture
fine-grained template details, leading to suboptimal accuracy and reduced
utility in downstream tasks requiring precise pattern identification. We
propose a character-level log parser utilizing a novel neural architecture that
aggregates character embeddings. Our approach estimates a sequence of
binary-coded decimals to achieve highly granular log templates extraction. Our
low-resource character-level parser, tested on revised Loghub-2k and a manually
annotated industrial dataset, matches LLM-based parsers in accuracy while
outperforming semantic parsers in efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对芬兰瑞典语（FS）的发音错误检测（MD）模型，适用于低资源语言，方法简单且语言无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大多数MD模型针对英语等主要语言，而低资源语言如芬兰瑞典语缺乏相关工具。

Method: 使用多语言wav2vec 2.0模型，结合熵正则化、温度缩放和top-k归一化，适应MD任务。

Result: 模型在召回率（43.2%）和精确率（29.8%）上取得平衡，优于基线模型（召回率77.5%，精确率17.6%）。

Conclusion: 该方法简单且语言无关，适用于其他低资源语言，为发音错误检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Mispronunciation detection (MD) models are the cornerstones of many language
learning applications. Unfortunately, most systems are built for English and
other major languages, while low-resourced language varieties, such as Finland
Swedish (FS), lack such tools. In this paper, we introduce our MD model for FS,
trained on 89 hours of first language (L1) speakers' spontaneous speech and
tested on 33 minutes of L2 transcribed read-aloud speech.
  We trained a multilingual wav2vec 2.0 model with entropy regularization,
followed by temperature scaling and top-k normalization after the inference to
better adapt it for MD. The main novelty of our method lies in its simplicity,
requiring minimal L2 data. The process is also language-independent, making it
suitable for other low-resource languages. Our proposed algorithm allows us to
balance Recall (43.2%) and Precision (29.8%), compared with the baseline
model's Recall (77.5%) and Precision (17.6%).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，预训练语言模型的规模与对人类阅读时间的预测能力呈负相关，且数据泄漏并非主要原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨预训练语言模型的规模与人类阅读时间预测能力之间的关系，并验证数据泄漏是否为主要影响因素。

Method: 通过两项研究：1) 分析五个自然阅读时间语料库在预训练数据中的泄漏情况；2) 使用泄漏极少的模型复现模型规模与预测能力的负相关关系。

Result: 研究发现数据泄漏较少，且模型规模与预测能力的负相关关系依然存在。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型的规模对预测人类阅读时间的负面影响并非由数据泄漏导致。

Abstract: In psycholinguistic modeling, surprisal from larger pre-trained language
models has been shown to be a poorer predictor of naturalistic human reading
times. However, it has been speculated that this may be due to data leakage
that caused language models to see the text stimuli during training. This paper
presents two studies to address this concern at scale. The first study reveals
relatively little leakage of five naturalistic reading time corpora in two
pre-training datasets in terms of length and frequency of token $n$-gram
overlap. The second study replicates the negative relationship between language
model size and the fit of surprisal to reading times using models trained on
'leakage-free' data that overlaps only minimally with the reading time corpora.
Taken together, this suggests that previous results using language models
trained on these corpora are not driven by the effects of data leakage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有归因方法要么过于笼统（整句关联），要么过于精确但与用户需求不匹配，需要一种更灵活、用户导向的归因方法。

Method: 提出LAQuer任务，比较了基于提示大语言模型（LLMs）和利用LLM内部表示的两种方法，并扩展了现有归因文本生成框架。

Result: LAQuer方法显著减少了归因文本的长度，在多文档摘要（MDS）和长形式问答（LFQA）任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: LAQuer任务提升了归因的实用性，提出了建模框架和基准，并推动了局部化归因研究的未来发展。

Abstract: Grounded text generation models often produce content that deviates from
their source material, requiring user verification to ensure accuracy. Existing
attribution methods associate entire sentences with source documents, which can
be overwhelming for users seeking to fact-check specific claims. In contrast,
existing sub-sentence attribution methods may be more precise but fail to align
with users' interests. In light of these limitations, we introduce Localized
Attribution Queries (LAQuer), a new task that localizes selected spans of
generated output to their corresponding source spans, allowing fine-grained and
user-directed attribution. We compare two approaches for the LAQuer task,
including prompting large language models (LLMs) and leveraging LLM internal
representations. We then explore a modeling framework that extends existing
attributed text generation methods to LAQuer. We evaluate this framework across
two grounded text generation tasks: Multi-document Summarization (MDS) and
Long-form Question Answering (LFQA). Our findings show that LAQuer methods
significantly reduce the length of the attributed text. Our contributions
include: (1) proposing the LAQuer task to enhance attribution usability, (2)
suggesting a modeling framework and benchmarking multiple baselines, and (3)
proposing a new evaluation setting to promote future research on localized
attribution in content-grounded generation.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在低资源语言中文化特定推理任务的不足，推动全球AI公平部署。

Method: 提出CG-CoT，结合密集向量检索文化背景与显式推理序列。

Result: 在约鲁巴谚语解释任务中，CG-CoT显著优于传统方法，验证了其文化对齐效果。

Conclusion: 需重新思考低资源NLP的评估方法，文化相关性比传统翻译指标更重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with culturally-specific reasoning
tasks, particularly in low-resource languages, hindering their global
applicability. Addressing this gap is crucial for equitable AI deployment. We
introduce Culturally-Grounded Chain-of-Thought (CG-CoT), a novel prompting
strategy that combines dense vector retrieval of cultural context with explicit
reasoning sequences. Our extensive experiments on Yoruba proverb interpretation
demonstrate that CG-CoT provides significantly higher culturally-aligned
accuracy and depth than traditional prompting methods, validated through both
automated metrics and LLM-based evaluations. Notably, we uncover stark
disparities between token-level translation metrics like BLEU and human-judged
cultural relevance, suggesting a rethinking of evaluation approaches for
low-resource NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补对非合作话语系统性理解的空白，尤其是在高风险的对抗性环境中。

Method: 引入CoBRA框架和三个可解释指标（BaT、PaT、NRBaT），并使用CHARM数据集验证框架有效性。

Result: LLMs在战略语言理解上表现有限，模型规模提升性能，但推理能力反而导致过度复杂和内部混乱。

Conclusion: LLMs在非合作话语中的实用性仍需改进，推理能力可能成为障碍。

Abstract: Language is often used strategically, particularly in high-stakes,
adversarial settings, yet most work on pragmatics and LLMs centers on
cooperativity. This leaves a gap in systematic understanding of non-cooperative
discourse. To address this, we introduce CoBRA (Cooperation-Breach Response
Assessment), along with three interpretable metrics -- Benefit at Turn (BaT),
Penalty at Turn (PaT), and Normalized Relative Benefit at Turn (NRBaT) -- to
quantify the perceived strategic effects of discourse moves. We also present
CHARM, an annotated dataset of real courtroom cross-examinations, to
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. Using these tools, we evaluate a
range of LLMs and show that LLMs generally exhibit limited pragmatic
understanding of strategic language. While model size shows an increase in
performance on our metrics, reasoning ability does not help and largely hurts,
introducing overcomplication and internal confusion.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的稀疏自编码器（SAE）架构，显式建模概念的语义层次结构，提升了重建能力、可解释性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏字典学习（如稀疏自编码器）虽然能学习可解释的概念，但未利用或表示概念间的语义关系。

Method: 引入改进的SAE架构，显式建模概念的语义层次结构。

Result: 实验表明，该架构能学习语义层次结构，并提升重建能力、可解释性和计算效率。

Conclusion: 改进的SAE架构通过学习语义层次结构，显著提升了性能和应用潜力。

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (and, in particular, sparse autoencoders) attempts
to learn a set of human-understandable concepts that can explain variation on
an abstract space. A basic limitation of this approach is that it neither
exploits nor represents the semantic relationships between the learned
concepts. In this paper, we introduce a modified SAE architecture that
explicitly models a semantic hierarchy of concepts. Application of this
architecture to the internal representations of large language models shows
both that semantic hierarchy can be learned, and that doing so improves both
reconstruction and interpretability. Additionally, the architecture leads to
significant improvements in computational efficiency.

Abstract: Detecting ambiguity is important for language understanding, including
uncertainty estimation, humour detection, and processing garden path sentences.
We assess language models' sensitivity to ambiguity by introducing an
adversarial ambiguity dataset that includes syntactic, lexical, and
phonological ambiguities along with adversarial variations (e.g., word-order
changes, synonym replacements, and random-based alterations). Our findings show
that direct prompting fails to robustly identify ambiguity, while linear probes
trained on model representations can decode ambiguity with high accuracy,
sometimes exceeding 90\%. Our results offer insights into the prompting
paradigm and how language models encode ambiguity at different layers. We
release both our code and data: https://github.com/coastalcph/lm_ambiguity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在外部drafters和自推测方法之间存在灵活性或效率的权衡，需要一种兼顾两者的解决方案。

Method: 利用Mamba（状态空间模型）的线性结构避免Transformer的二次复杂度，并结合测试时树搜索算法生成高质量候选。

Result: Mamba-based drafters在速度和内存效率上优于现有外部方法，与自推测方法相当，同时保持跨模型适应性。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的drafters是高效且灵活的解决方案，适用于加速LLM生成。

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising approach to accelerating
large language model (LLM) generation using a fast drafter while maintaining
alignment with the target model's distribution. However, existing approaches
face a trade-off: external drafters offer flexibility but can suffer from
slower drafting, while self-speculation methods use drafters tailored to the
target model but require re-training. In this paper, we introduce novel
drafters based on Mamba, a state-of-the-art state space model (SSM), as a
solution that combines the best aspects of both approaches. By leveraging the
linear structure of SSMs, our approach avoids the quadratic complexity inherent
in traditional Transformer-based methods, enabling faster drafting and lower
memory usage while maintaining the flexibility to work across different target
models. We further enhance efficiency with a novel test-time tree search
algorithm for generating high-quality draft candidates. Our empirical
evaluation demonstrates that Mamba-based drafters not only outperform existing
external drafting methods but are also comparable to state-of-the-art
self-speculation approaches while using less memory and maintaining their
cross-model adaptability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理超出预训练模型上下文限制的长上下文是现实应用中的关键挑战，现有方法在信息保存或资源消耗上存在不足。

Method: REFORM采用两阶段方法：增量处理输入块并维护压缩KV缓存，构建跨层上下文嵌入；通过相似性匹配识别关键令牌并选择性重计算KV缓存。

Result: 在1M上下文长度下，REFORM在RULER和BABILong上分别实现50%和27%的性能提升，同时在Infinite-Bench和MM-NIAH上表现优异，推理时间减少30%，峰值内存使用降低5%。

Conclusion: REFORM在长上下文处理中实现了高效性和性能的平衡，适用于多种任务和领域。

Abstract: As large language models increasingly gain popularity in real-world
applications, processing extremely long contexts, often exceeding the model's
pre-trained context limits, has emerged as a critical challenge. While existing
approaches to efficient long-context processing show promise, recurrent
compression-based methods struggle with information preservation, whereas
random access approaches require substantial memory resources. We introduce
REFORM, a novel inference framework that efficiently handles long contexts
through a two-phase approach. First, it incrementally processes input chunks
while maintaining a compressed KV cache, constructs cross-layer context
embeddings, and utilizes early exit strategy for improved efficiency. Second,
it identifies and gathers essential tokens via similarity matching and
selectively recomputes the KV cache. Compared to baselines, REFORM achieves
over 50% and 27% performance gains on RULER and BABILong respectively at 1M
context length. It also outperforms baselines on Infinite-Bench and MM-NIAH,
demonstrating flexibility across diverse tasks and domains. Additionally,
REFORM reduces inference time by 30% and peak memory usage by 5%, achieving
both efficiency and superior performance.

Abstract: We introduce the $\underline{Ko}rean \underline{G}rammar
\underline{E}valuation Bench\underline{M}ark (KoGEM)$, designed to assess the
linguistic competence of LLMs and humans in Korean. KoGEM consists of 1.5k
multiple-choice QA pairs covering five main categories and 16 subcategories.
The zero-shot evaluation of 27 LLMs of various sizes and types reveals that
while LLMs perform remarkably well on straightforward tasks requiring primarily
definitional knowledge, they struggle with tasks that demand the integration of
real-world experiential knowledge, such as phonological rules and
pronunciation. Furthermore, our in-depth analysis suggests that incorporating
such experiential knowledge could enhance the linguistic competence of LLMs.
With KoGEM, we not only highlight the limitations of current LLMs in linguistic
competence but also uncover hidden facets of LLMs in linguistic competence,
paving the way for enhancing comprehensive language understanding. Our code and

Method: 开发ExpertLongBench基准和CLEAR评估框架，通过任务特定评分表和检查表提取信息，实现细粒度评估。

Result: 现有LLM表现不佳（最高F1得分26.8%），模型能生成相关内容但准确性不足，CLEAR框架可通过开源模型实现低成本评估。

Conclusion: ExpertLongBench和CLEAR为专家级任务提供了有效的评估工具，但现有LLM仍需改进以满足专家需求。

Abstract: This paper introduces ExpertLongBench, an expert-level benchmark containing
11 tasks from 9 domains that reflect realistic expert workflows and
applications. Beyond question answering, the application-driven tasks in
ExpertLongBench demand long-form outputs that can exceed 5,000 tokens and
strict adherence to domain-specific requirements. Notably, each task in
ExpertLongBench includes a rubric, designed or validated by domain experts, to
specify task requirements and guide output evaluation. Furthermore, we propose
CLEAR, an evaluation framework that supports accurate evaluation of long-form
model outputs in our benchmark. To achieve fine-grained, expert-aligned
evaluation, CLEAR derives checklists from both model outputs and references by
extracting information corresponding to items in the task-specific rubric.
Checklist items for model outputs are then compared with corresponding items
for reference outputs to assess their correctness, enabling grounded
evaluation. We benchmark 11 large language models (LLMs) and analyze components
in CLEAR, showing that (1) existing LLMs, with the top performer achieving only
a 26.8% F1 score, require significant improvement for expert-level tasks; (2)
models can generate content corresponding to the required aspects, though often
not accurately; and (3) accurate checklist extraction and comparison in CLEAR
can be achieved by open-weight models for more scalable and low-cost usage.

Motivation: 中医的隐式推理、多样文本形式和缺乏标准化对计算建模和评估提出了挑战，而现有基准在中医领域的系统评估不足。

Method: 开发了MTCMB，包含12个子数据集，涵盖知识问答、语言理解、诊断推理、处方生成和安全性评估五大类。

Result: 初步结果显示，当前大语言模型在基础知识上表现良好，但在临床推理、处方规划和安全合规性方面不足。

Conclusion: MTCMB的推出填补了中医领域评估的空白，为开发更可靠的中医AI系统提供了指导。

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a holistic medical system with
millennia of accumulated clinical experience, playing a vital role in global
healthcare-particularly across East Asia. However, the implicit reasoning,
diverse textual forms, and lack of standardization in TCM pose major challenges
for computational modeling and evaluation. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable potential in processing natural language across diverse
domains, including general medicine. Yet, their systematic evaluation in the
TCM domain remains underdeveloped. Existing benchmarks either focus narrowly on
factual question answering or lack domain-specific tasks and clinical realism.
To fill this gap, we introduce MTCMB-a Multi-Task Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs
on TCM Knowledge, Reasoning, and Safety. Developed in collaboration with
certified TCM experts, MTCMB comprises 12 sub-datasets spanning five major
categories: knowledge QA, language understanding, diagnostic reasoning,
prescription generation, and safety evaluation. The benchmark integrates
real-world case records, national licensing exams, and classical texts,
providing an authentic and comprehensive testbed for TCM-capable models.
Preliminary results indicate that current LLMs perform well on foundational
knowledge but fall short in clinical reasoning, prescription planning, and
safety compliance. These findings highlight the urgent need for domain-aligned
benchmarks like MTCMB to guide the development of more competent and
trustworthy medical AI systems. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are

Motivation: 研究动机是理解潜在条件如何影响复杂事件结果，以验证相关主张。

Method: 方法包括结合和增强两个现有数据集（目标和状态）的标注，设计条件推理任务，并测试不同规模和意图对齐的LLM。

Result: 结果表明，条件在上下文缺失时有用，不同模型在生成和识别条件的能力上差异显著，GPT-4o等大模型在无约束情况下更谨慎。

Conclusion: 结论是条件分析有助于验证结果，但模型能力差异显著，大模型在不确定条件下表现更稳健。

Abstract: Knowing which latent conditions lead to a particular outcome is useful for
critically examining claims made about complex event outcomes. Identifying
implied conditions and examining their influence on an outcome is challenging.
We handle this by combining and augmenting annotations from two existing
datasets consisting of goals and states, and explore the influence of
conditions through our research questions and Condition-based Reasoning tasks.
We examine open and closed LLMs of varying sizes and intent-alignment on our
reasoning tasks and find that conditions are useful when not all context is
available. Models differ widely in their ability to generate and identify
outcome-variant conditions which affects their performance on outcome
validation when conditions are used to replace missing context. Larger models
like GPT-4o, are more cautious in such less constrained situations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于双数组字典树（DA-trie）和标记-压缩垃圾回收原则的内存优化框架，显著减少了FastText的内存占用，同时保持嵌入质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FastText的哈希分桶机制在大规模工业部署中存在语义漂移和高内存消耗的问题，亟需优化。

Method: 通过构建前缀字典树、前缀和后缀相似性压缩以及标记-压缩内存重组，实现内存优化。

Result: 在3000万中文词汇数据集上，内存占用从100GB降至30GB，性能几乎无损。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了成本，提升了模型加载速度和可靠性，适用于工业部署。

Abstract: FastText has established itself as a fundamental algorithm for learning word
representations, demonstrating exceptional capability in handling
out-of-vocabulary words through character-level n-gram embeddings. However, its
hash-based bucketing mechanism introduces critical limitations for large-scale
industrial deployment: hash collisions cause semantic drift, and memory
requirements become prohibitively expensive when dealing with real-world
vocabularies containing millions of terms. This paper presents a comprehensive
memory optimization framework that fundamentally reimagines FastText's memory
management through the integration of double-array trie (DA-trie) structures
and mark-compact garbage collection principles. Our approach leverages the
linguistic insight that n-grams sharing common prefixes or suffixes exhibit
highly correlated embeddings due to co-occurrence patterns in natural language.
By systematically identifying and merging semantically similar embeddings based
on structural relationships, we achieve compression ratios of 4:1 to 10:1 while
maintaining near-perfect embedding quality. The algorithm consists of four
sophisticated phases: prefix trie construction with embedding mapping,
prefix-based similarity compression, suffix-based similarity compression, and
mark-compact memory reorganization. Comprehensive experiments on a 30-million
Chinese vocabulary dataset demonstrate memory reduction from over 100GB to
approximately 30GB with negligible performance degradation. Our industrial

Abstract: Personalized AI assistants, a hallmark of the human-like capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs), are a challenging application that intertwines
multiple problems in LLM research. Despite the growing interest in the
development of personalized assistants, the lack of an open-source
conversational dataset tailored for personalization remains a significant
obstacle for researchers in the field. To address this research gap, we
introduce HiCUPID, a new benchmark to probe and unleash the potential of LLMs
to deliver personalized responses. Alongside a conversational dataset, HiCUPID
provides a Llama-3.2-based automated evaluation model whose assessment closely
mirrors human preferences. We release our dataset, evaluation model, and code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种改进CTC模型中罕见词识别准确率的方法，无需额外训练或TTS系统，通过中间层声学特征进行关键词检测并施加偏置，实验显示未知词F1分数提升29%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端语音识别方法对训练数据词汇的偏倚问题，尤其是专有名词和未知词的识别不准确。

Method: 使用中间层声学特征进行关键词检测，采用通配符CTC实现快速且模糊匹配，对检测到的关键词在后续层施加偏置。

Result: 在日语语音识别实验中，未知词的F1分数提升了29%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练模型，适用于大规模模型，显著提高了罕见词的识别准确率。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in end-to-end speech recognition methods, the output
tends to be biased to the training data's vocabulary, resulting in inaccurate
recognition of proper nouns and other unknown terms. To address this issue, we
propose a method to improve recognition accuracy of such rare words in
CTC-based models without additional training or text-to-speech systems.
Specifically, keyword spotting is performed using acoustic features of
intermediate layers during inference, and a bias is applied to the subsequent
layers of the acoustic model for detected keywords. For keyword detection, we
adopt a wildcard CTC that is both fast and tolerant of ambiguous matches,
allowing flexible handling of words that are difficult to match strictly. Since
this method does not require retraining of existing models, it can be easily
applied to even large-scale models. In experiments on Japanese speech
recognition, the proposed method achieved a 29% improvement in the F1 score for
unknown words.

TL;DR: 论文研究了上下文学习（ICL）在长文本生成任务中的不足，提出了LongGuide方法，通过生成任务语言和格式的指导准则，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL在问答任务中表现良好，但在长文本生成任务（如摘要）中表现不佳，需要更明确的任务分布指导。

Method: 提出LongGuide方法，生成两种并行指导准则（Metric Guidelines和Output Constraint Guidelines），自动选择最佳组合。

Result: LongGuide显著提升了开源和闭源LLM的性能，在零样本和少样本设置下均提高了5%以上。

Conclusion: LongGuide具有通用性，可被弱模型学习以增强强模型，并能与自动提示优化器协同工作。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is an important yet not fully understood ability of
pre-trained large language models (LLMs). It can greatly enhance task
performance using a few examples, termed demonstrations, without fine-tuning.
Although effective in question answering, ICL often underperforms in long-form
generation tasks such as summarization. Under appropriately realistic
assumptions, we empirically and theoretically show that ICL demonstrations
alone are insufficient to teach LLMs the task language and format distributions
for generation. We argue for explicit exposure to the task distributions and
hypothesize that defining them by prompting enhances model performance. To this
end, we present LongGuide, which efficiently generates two parallel streams of
guidelines capturing task language and format properties: (i) Metric Guidelines
(MGs) that instruct models to optimize self-evaluated metrics; and (ii) Output
Constraint Guidelines (OCGs) that constrain generation at both token and
sentence levels. LongGuide automatically selects the best combination of
guidelines, improving both strong open- and closed-source LLMs by over 5% in
both zero- and few-shot settings. We show that LongGuide is generalizable,
learnable by weak models to enhance strong ones, and integrates synergistically
with automatic prompt optimizers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型去毒化方法通常依赖大规模非毒性数据或人工标注偏好数据，计算成本高且可能影响模型的流畅性和上下文理解。

Method: 利用预训练的紧凑校准模型，通过轻量级干预在LLM生成过程中引导去毒化，学习非毒性数据的嵌入空间。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能有效降低毒性，同时保持内容的合理表达。

Conclusion: 该方法简单高效，无需多次训练，适用于多种LLM，且不影响流畅性和上下文理解。

Abstract: Existing approaches for Large language model (LLM) detoxification generally
rely on training on large-scale non-toxic or human-annotated preference data,
designing prompts to instruct the LLM to generate safe content, or modifying
the model parameters to remove toxic information, which are computationally
expensive, lack robustness, and often compromise LLMs' fluency and contextual
understanding. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach for
LLM detoxification, which leverages a compact, pre-trained calibration model
that guides the detoxification process of a target LLM via a lightweight
intervention in its generation pipeline. By learning a detoxified embedding
space from non-toxic data, the calibration model effectively steers the LLM
away from generating harmful content. This approach only requires a one-time
training of the calibration model that is able to be seamlessly applied to
multiple LLMs without compromising fluency or contextual understanding.
Experiment results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that our approach
reduces toxicity while maintaining reasonable content expression.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的文本到结构生成框架SPT，通过将预定义模式视为参数化工具，解决了UIE在模式选择和动态生成中的适应性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UIE在预定义模式和动态模式生成之间缺乏适应性，尤其是在模式选择较多时。

Method: SPT框架将模式视为参数化工具，支持模式检索、填充和生成，统一了封闭、开放和按需IE任务。

Result: 实验表明SPT能自适应处理四种IE任务，性能与现有系统相当且参数更少。

Conclusion: SPT为UIE提供了一种灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Universal information extraction (UIE) primarily employs an extractive
generation approach with large language models (LLMs), typically outputting
structured information based on predefined schemas such as JSON or tables. UIE
suffers from a lack of adaptability when selecting between predefined schemas
and on-the-fly schema generation within the in-context learning paradigm,
especially when there are numerous schemas to choose from. In this paper, we
propose a unified adaptive text-to-structure generation framework, called
Schema as Parameterized Tools (SPT), which reimagines the tool-calling
capability of LLMs by treating predefined schemas as parameterized tools for
tool selection and parameter filling. Specifically, our SPT method can be
applied to unify closed, open, and on-demand IE tasks by adopting Schema
Retrieval by fetching the relevant schemas from a predefined pool, Schema
Filling by extracting information and filling slots as with tool parameters, or
Schema Generation by synthesizing new schemas with uncovered cases. Experiments
show that the SPT method can handle four distinct IE tasks adaptively,
delivering robust schema retrieval and selection performance. SPT also achieves
comparable extraction performance to LoRA baselines and current leading UIE
systems with significantly fewer trainable parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非英语社区的医疗数据分散且难以验证，缺乏标准化方法构建基准，因此需要一种可扩展的方法来支持多语言医疗基准的开发。

Method: 通过验证性来源（如医学考试和临床记录）构建基准，并由医学专家标注，涵盖四个难度级别。

Result: 发布了包含公共样本集（4k题）、完整公共集（10k题）和私有集（2k题）的基准，支持多语言扩展。

Conclusion: 该方法可推广至其他语言，开源数据构建流程以支持未来多语言医疗基准的开发。

Abstract: Medical benchmarks are indispensable for evaluating the capabilities of
language models in healthcare for non-English-speaking communities,therefore
help ensuring the quality of real-life applications. However, not every
community has sufficient resources and standardized methods to effectively
build and design such benchmark, and available non-English medical data is
normally fragmented and difficult to verify. We developed an approach to tackle
this problem and applied it to create the first Vietnamese medical question
benchmark, featuring 14,000 multiple-choice questions across 34 medical
specialties. Our benchmark was constructed using various verifiable sources,
including carefully curated medical exams and clinical records, and eventually
annotated by medical experts. The benchmark includes four difficulty levels,
ranging from foundational biological knowledge commonly found in textbooks to
typical clinical case studies that require advanced reasoning. This design
enables assessment of both the breadth and depth of language models' medical
understanding in the target language thanks to its extensive coverage and
in-depth subject-specific expertise. We release the benchmark in three parts: a
sample public set (4k questions), a full public set (10k questions), and a
private set (2k questions) used for leaderboard evaluation. Each set contains
all medical subfields and difficulty levels. Our approach is scalable to other
languages, and we open-source our data construction pipeline to support the
development of future multilingual benchmarks in the medical domain.

Result: 平台展示了多种应用，如探索常见关切示例、分析18.6万样本的时间趋势，以及事件前后的主题频率变化。

Conclusion: ConcernScope为公共卫生官员提供了有效工具，以理解和应对在线内容中的健康关切。

Abstract: A recent rise in online content expressing concerns with public health
initiatives has contributed to already stalled uptake of preemptive measures
globally. Future public health efforts must attempt to understand such content,
what concerns it may raise among readers, and how to effectively respond to it.
To this end, we present ConcernScope, a platform that uses a teacher-student
framework for knowledge transfer between large language models and light-weight
classifiers to quickly and effectively identify the health concerns raised in a
text corpus. The platform allows uploading massive files directly,
automatically scraping specific URLs, and direct text editing. ConcernScope is
built on top of a taxonomy of public health concerns. Intended for public
health officials, we demonstrate several applications of this platform: guided
data exploration to find useful examples of common concerns found in online
community datasets, identification of trends in concerns through an example
time series analysis of 186,000 samples, and finding trends in topic frequency
before and after significant events.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的弱到强情景学习框架，通过蒙特卡洛树搜索和蒸馏方法，提升语言模型在规划和问答任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情景学习方法在可扩展性和集成性上存在不足，尤其是中等规模语言模型（7B参数）。大型语言模型（70-405B参数）虽具备更强的抽象能力，但缺乏有效利用经验流的机制。

Method: 结合蒙特卡洛树搜索进行结构化经验收集，并采用新型蒸馏方法，保留语言模型固有能力的同时嵌入情景记忆。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在规划和问答任务中超越现有最先进专有语言模型3.45%，且在深层模型中任务对齐显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂规划场景中表现出稳定的泛化能力，优于基线方法。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) require robust episodic grounding-the capacity to learn
from and apply past experiences-to excel at physical planning tasks. Current
episodic grounding approaches struggle with scalability and integration,
limiting their effectiveness, especially for medium-sized LMs (7B parameters).
While larger LMs (70-405B parameters) possess superior hierarchical
representations and extensive pre-trained knowledge, they encounter a
fundamental scale paradox: despite their advanced abstraction capabilities,
they lack efficient mechanisms to leverage experience streams. We propose a
scalable weak-to-strong episodic learning framework that effectively transfers
episodic behaviors from smaller to larger LMs. This framework integrates Monte
Carlo tree search for structured experience collection with a novel
distillation method, preserving the inherent LM capabilities while embedding
episodic memory. Experiments demonstrate our method surpasses state-of-the-art
proprietary LMs by 3.45% across diverse planning and question-answering tasks.
Layer-wise probing further indicates significant improvements in task
alignment, especially within deeper LM layers, highlighting stable
generalization even for previously unseen scenarios with increased planning
complexity-conditions where baseline methods degrade markedly.

Motivation: 心理支持热线需求激增，但面临资源不足问题。LLMs可能提供支持，但其在情感敏感场景中的能力尚不明确。

Method: 使用PsyCrisisBench（540条标注数据）评估64种LLMs在四项任务中的表现，采用零样本、少样本和微调方法，以F1分数衡量性能。

Result: LLMs在自杀倾向检测（F1=0.880）、自杀计划识别（F1=0.779）和风险评估（F1=0.907）中表现优异，情绪状态识别较弱（F1=0.709）。微调的小模型（Qwen2.5-1.5B）优于大模型。开源模型与闭源模型差距缩小。量化技术减少70%显存需求。

Conclusion: LLMs在结构化心理危机评估中潜力巨大，尤其是微调后。情绪识别仍需改进。开源模型与量化技术为实际部署提供可行性。PsyCrisisBench为模型开发和伦理部署提供框架。

Abstract: Psychological support hotlines are critical for crisis intervention but face
significant challenges due to rising demand. Large language models (LLMs) could
support crisis assessments, yet their capabilities in emotionally sensitive
contexts remain unclear. We introduce PsyCrisisBench, a benchmark of 540
annotated transcripts from the Hangzhou Psychological Assistance Hotline,
assessing four tasks: mood status recognition, suicidal ideation detection,
suicide plan identification, and risk assessment. We evaluated 64 LLMs across
15 families (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek) using zero-shot,
few-shot, and fine-tuning paradigms. Performance was measured by F1-score, with
statistical comparisons via Welch's t-tests. LLMs performed strongly on
suicidal ideation detection (F1=0.880), suicide plan identification (F1=0.779),
and risk assessment (F1=0.907), improved with few-shot and fine-tuning. Mood
status recognition was more challenging (max F1=0.709), likely due to lost
vocal cues and ambiguity. A fine-tuned 1.5B-parameter model (Qwen2.5-1.5B)
surpassed larger models on mood and suicidal ideation. Open-source models like
QwQ-32B performed comparably to closed-source on most tasks (p>0.3), though
closed models retained an edge in mood detection (p=0.007). Performance scaled
with size up to a point; quantization (AWQ) reduced GPU memory by 70% with
minimal F1 degradation. LLMs show substantial promise in structured
psychological crisis assessments, especially with fine-tuning. Mood recognition
remains limited due to contextual complexity. The narrowing gap between open-
and closed-source models, combined with efficient quantization, suggests
feasible integration. PsyCrisisBench offers a robust evaluation framework to
guide model development and ethical deployment in mental health.

Motivation: 当前概念库存在冗余或覆盖不足的问题，需要优化概念数量并改进概念评分机制。

Method: 采用动态代理方法调整概念库，并提出CoCoBMs模型，包含可编辑矩阵以修正概念评分。

Result: 在6个数据集上的评估显示，分类准确率提升6%，可解释性评估提升30%。

Conclusion: 动态调整概念库和改进评分机制显著提升了CBMs的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) decompose image classification into a
process governed by interpretable, human-readable concepts. Recent advances in
CBMs have used Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate candidate concepts.
However, a critical question remains: What is the optimal number of concepts to
use? Current concept banks suffer from redundancy or insufficient coverage. To
address this issue, we introduce a dynamic, agent-based approach that adjusts
the concept bank in response to environmental feedback, optimizing the number
of concepts for sufficiency yet concise coverage. Moreover, we propose
Conditional Concept Bottleneck Models (CoCoBMs) to overcome the limitations in
traditional CBMs' concept scoring mechanisms. It enhances the accuracy of
assessing each concept's contribution to classification tasks and feature an
editable matrix that allows LLMs to correct concept scores that conflict with
their internal knowledge. Our evaluations across 6 datasets show that our
method not only improves classification accuracy by 6% but also enhances
interpretability assessments by 30%.

linguistic and cultural heritage. Developing Arabic LLMs (ALLMs) presents an
unparalleled opportunity to bridge technological gaps and empower communities.
The journey of ALLMs has been both fascinating and complex, evolving from
rudimentary text processing systems to sophisticated AI-driven models. This
article explores the trajectory of ALLMs, from their inception to the present
day, highlighting the efforts to evaluate these models through benchmarks and
public leaderboards. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities that
ALLMs present for the Arab world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试多关注单轮或单步任务，无法捕捉现实场景中的迭代推理需求。

Method: TurnBench采用交互式代码破解任务，分为Classic和Nightmare两种模式，测试模型的多轮推理能力。

Result: 最佳模型在Classic模式下准确率为81.5%，但在Nightmare模式下降至17.8%，而人类参与者均达到100%。

Conclusion: TurnBench为LLMs的多步、多轮推理能力提供了严格的测试平台，揭示了当前模型的不足。

Abstract: Despite impressive advances in large language models (LLMs), existing
benchmarks often focus on single-turn or single-step tasks, failing to capture
the kind of iterative reasoning required in real-world settings. To address
this limitation, we introduce TurnBench, a novel benchmark that evaluates
multi-turn, multi-step reasoning through an interactive code-breaking task
inspired by a "Turing Machine Board Game." In each episode, a model must
uncover hidden logical or arithmetic rules by making sequential guesses,
receiving structured feedback, and integrating clues across multiple rounds.
This dynamic setup requires models to reason over time, adapt based on past
information, and maintain consistency across steps-capabilities underexplored
in current benchmarks. TurnBench includes two modes: Classic, which tests
standard reasoning, and Nightmare, which introduces increased complexity and
requires robust inferential chains. To support fine-grained analysis, we
provide ground-truth annotations for intermediate reasoning steps. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals significant gaps: the best model
achieves 81.5% accuracy in Classic mode, but performance drops to 17.8% in
Nightmare mode. In contrast, human participants achieve 100% in both,
underscoring the challenge TurnBench poses to current models. By incorporating
feedback loops and hiding task rules, TurnBench reduces contamination risks and
provides a rigorous testbed for diagnosing and advancing multi-step, multi-turn
reasoning in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流程图在关键领域（如物流、医疗和工程）中的自动化处理可靠性因LLM的视觉幻觉问题而受到挑战。

Method: 提出FlowPathAgent，一种神经符号代理，通过图推理实现细粒度归因，包括流程图分割、符号图转换和动态交互生成归因路径。

Result: FlowPathAgent在FlowExplainBench数据集上优于基线方法10-14%，有效减少了LLM回答中的视觉幻觉。

Conclusion: FlowPathAgent通过细粒度归因提高了LLM对流程图解释的可验证性和可解释性。

Abstract: Flowcharts are a critical tool for visualizing decision-making processes.
However, their non-linear structure and complex visual-textual relationships
make it challenging to interpret them using LLMs, as vision-language models
frequently hallucinate nonexistent connections and decision paths when
analyzing these diagrams. This leads to compromised reliability for automated
flowchart processing in critical domains such as logistics, health, and
engineering. We introduce the task of Fine-grained Flowchart Attribution, which
traces specific components grounding a flowchart referring LLM response.
Flowchart Attribution ensures the verifiability of LLM predictions and improves
explainability by linking generated responses to the flowchart's structure. We
propose FlowPathAgent, a neurosymbolic agent that performs fine-grained post
hoc attribution through graph-based reasoning. It first segments the flowchart,
then converts it into a structured symbolic graph, and then employs an agentic
approach to dynamically interact with the graph, to generate attribution paths.
Additionally, we present FlowExplainBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating
flowchart attributions across diverse styles, domains, and question types.
Experimental results show that FlowPathAgent mitigates visual hallucinations in
LLM answers over flowchart QA, outperforming strong baselines by 10-14% on our
proposed FlowExplainBench dataset.

TL;DR: RLVR通过分解学习信号为正面和负面样本强化（PSR和NSR），发现仅使用负面样本训练也能显著提升模型性能，而仅强化正确样本会降低多样性。NSR通过抑制错误生成和重新分配概率质量来优化模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RLVR在语言模型推理任务中的机制，探索正面和负面样本强化对模型性能的影响。

Method: 分解RLVR学习信号为PSR和NSR，训练Qwen2.5-Math-7B和Qwen3-4B模型，分析梯度行为。

Result: 仅负面样本训练（NSR）能显著提升性能，而仅正面样本训练（PSR）会降低多样性。NSR通过抑制错误生成优化模型。

Conclusion: 负面样本强化对性能提升贡献显著，提出了一种加权NSR的RL目标变体，进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for training language models (LMs) on reasoning tasks that elicit emergent long
chains of thought (CoTs). Unlike supervised learning, it updates the model
using both correct and incorrect samples via policy gradients. To better
understand its mechanism, we decompose the learning signal into reinforcing
correct responses and penalizing incorrect ones, referred to as Positive and
Negative Sample Reinforcement (PSR and NSR), respectively. We train
Qwen2.5-Math-7B and Qwen3-4B on a mathematical reasoning dataset and uncover a
surprising result: training with only negative samples -- without reinforcing
correct responses -- can be highly effective: it consistently improves
performance over the base model across the entire Pass@$k$ spectrum ($k$ up to
$256$), often matching or surpassing PPO and GRPO. In contrast, reinforcing
only correct responses improves Pass@$1$ but degrades performance at higher
$k$, due to reduced diversity. These inference-scaling trends highlight that
solely penalizing incorrect responses may contribute more to performance than
previously recognized. Through gradient analysis, we show that NSR works by
suppressing incorrect generations and redistributing probability mass toward
other plausible candidates, guided by the model's prior beliefs. It refines the
model's existing knowledge rather than introducing entirely new behaviors.
Building on this insight, we propose a simple variant of the RL objective that
upweights NSR, and show that it consistently improves overall Pass@$k$
performance on MATH, AIME 2025, and AMC23. Our code is available at
https://github.com/TianHongZXY/RLVR-Decomposed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理咨询对话数据集存在多样性不足、真实性差及隐私伦理问题，需要一种既能保证数据质量又能避免隐私风险的方法。

Method: 采用角色扮演方法，由训练有素的咨询师模拟咨询师-客户互动，构建包含6,589个长对话及客户反馈的KokoroChat数据集。

Result: 实验表明，基于KokoroChat微调的开源语言模型显著提升了生成咨询回复的质量和对话自动评估效果。

Conclusion: 角色扮演方法有效解决了心理咨询对话数据集的局限性，KokoroChat为相关研究提供了高质量数据支持。

Abstract: Generating psychological counseling responses with language models relies
heavily on high-quality datasets. Crowdsourced data collection methods require
strict worker training, and data from real-world counseling environments may
raise privacy and ethical concerns. While recent studies have explored using
large language models (LLMs) to augment psychological counseling dialogue
datasets, the resulting data often suffers from limited diversity and
authenticity. To address these limitations, this study adopts a role-playing
approach where trained counselors simulate counselor-client interactions,
ensuring high-quality dialogues while mitigating privacy risks. Using this
method, we construct KokoroChat, a Japanese psychological counseling dialogue
dataset comprising 6,589 long-form dialogues, each accompanied by comprehensive
client feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source
LLMs with KokoroChat improves both the quality of generated counseling
responses and the automatic evaluation of counseling dialogues. The KokoroChat
dataset is available at https://github.com/UEC-InabaLab/KokoroChat.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最大均值差异（MMD）的新方法MMD-Flagger，用于检测大语言模型生成的幻觉内容，并在机器翻译数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型生成的未基于现实的幻觉内容阻碍了其在关键应用中的使用，因此检测此类内容至关重要。

Method: 利用MMD（一种非参数分布距离）跟踪生成文档与不同温度参数生成文档之间的差异，通过分析轨迹形状检测幻觉。

Result: 在机器翻译数据集上，MMD-Flagger优于其他自然竞争方法。

Conclusion: MMD-Flagger是一种有效的幻觉检测方法，适用于大语言模型生成内容的验证。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become pervasive in our everyday life. Yet,
a fundamental obstacle prevents their use in many critical applications: their
propensity to generate fluent, human-quality content that is not grounded in
reality. The detection of such hallucinations is thus of the highest
importance. In this work, we propose a new method to flag hallucinated content,
MMD-Flagger. It relies on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), a non-parametric
distance between distributions. On a high-level perspective, MMD-Flagger tracks
the MMD between the generated documents and documents generated with various
temperature parameters. We show empirically that inspecting the shape of this
trajectory is sufficient to detect most hallucinations. This novel method is
benchmarked on two machine translation datasets, on which it outperforms
natural competitors.

Method: 提出AdaRewriter框架，利用对比排序损失训练奖励模型，在推理时选择最优查询重写。

Result: 在五个对话搜索数据集上，AdaRewriter显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 测试时适应在对话查询重写中具有巨大潜力，AdaRewriter展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Prompting-based conversational query reformulation has emerged as a powerful
approach for conversational search, refining ambiguous user queries into
standalone search queries. Best-of-N reformulation over the generated
candidates via prompting shows impressive potential scaling capability.
However, both the previous tuning methods (training time) and adaptation
approaches (test time) can not fully unleash their benefits. In this paper, we
propose AdaRewriter, a novel framework for query reformulation using an
outcome-supervised reward model via test-time adaptation. By training a
lightweight reward model with contrastive ranking loss, AdaRewriter selects the
most promising reformulation during inference. Notably, it can operate
effectively in black-box systems, including commercial LLM APIs. Experiments on
five conversational search datasets show that AdaRewriter significantly
outperforms the existing methods across most settings, demonstrating the
potential of test-time adaptation for conversational query reformulation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在敏感领域使用时可能泄露个人数据，现有匿名化方法依赖昂贵且可能不安全的专有模型，如GPT-4。

Method: SEAL框架利用LLM匿名器和推理模型之间的对抗性交互，收集匿名化文本和推断属性的轨迹，通过监督微调和偏好学习将能力蒸馏到SLMs中。

Conclusion: SEAL框架有效训练SLMs成为高效的匿名化工具，同时公开实验数据集以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in sensitive domains,
where their ability to infer personal data from seemingly benign text poses
emerging privacy risks. While recent LLM-based anonymization methods help
mitigate such risks, they often rely on proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4),
raising concerns about cost and the potential exposure of sensitive data to
untrusted external systems. To address this, we introduce SElf-refining
Anonymization with Language model (SEAL), a novel distillation framework for
training small language models (SLMs) to perform effective anonymization
without relying on external costly models at inference time. We leverage
adversarial interactions between an LLM anonymizer and an inference model to
collect trajectories of anonymized texts and inferred attributes, which are
used to distill anonymization, adversarial inference, and utility evaluation
capabilities into SLMs via supervised fine-tuning and preference learning. The
resulting models learn to both anonymize text and critique their outputs,
enabling iterative improvement of anonymization quality via self-refinement.
Experiments on SynthPAI, a dataset of synthetic personal profiles and text
comments, demonstrate that SLMs trained with SEAL achieve substantial
improvements in anonymization capabilities. Notably, 8B models attain a
privacy-utility trade-off comparable to that of the GPT-4 anonymizer and, with
self-refinement, even surpass it in terms of privacy. These results show the
effectiveness of our adversarial distillation framework in training SLMs as
efficient anonymizers. To facilitate further research, we release the full
dataset used in our experiments.

Result: 降维至0.5%原始维度时，分类和聚类性能下降很小；嵌入在分类和聚类中具有更高冗余性。

Conclusion: 高维嵌入在分类和聚类任务中冗余性高，降维可行且对性能影响小。

Abstract: Prompt-based text embedding models, which generate task-specific embeddings
upon receiving tailored prompts, have recently demonstrated remarkable
performance. However, their resulting embeddings often have thousands of
dimensions, leading to high storage costs and increased computational costs of
embedding-based operations. In this paper, we investigate how post-hoc
dimensionality reduction applied to the embeddings affects the performance of
various tasks that leverage these embeddings, specifically classification,
clustering, retrieval, and semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks. Our
experiments show that even a naive dimensionality reduction, which keeps only
the first 25% of the dimensions of the embeddings, results in a very slight
performance degradation, indicating that these embeddings are highly redundant.
Notably, for classification and clustering, even when embeddings are reduced to
less than 0.5% of the original dimensionality the performance degradation is
very small. To quantitatively analyze this redundancy, we perform an analysis
based on the intrinsic dimensionality and isotropy of the embeddings. Our
analysis reveals that embeddings for classification and clustering, which are
considered to have very high dimensional redundancy, exhibit lower intrinsic
dimensionality and less isotropy compared with those for retrieval and STS.

Abstract: Extracting useful signals or pattern to support important business decisions
for example analyzing investment product traction and discovering customer
preference, risk monitoring etc. from unstructured text is a challenging task.
Capturing interaction of entities or concepts and association mining is a
crucial component in text mining, enabling information extraction and reasoning
over and knowledge discovery from text. Furthermore, it can be used to enrich
or filter knowledge graphs to guide exploration processes, descriptive
analytics and uncover hidden stories in the text. In this paper, we introduce a
domain independent pipeline i.e., generalized framework to enable document
filtering, entity extraction using various sources (or techniques) as plug-ins
and association mining to build any text mining business use-case and
quantitatively define a scoring metric for ranking purpose. The proposed
framework has three major components a) Document filtering: filtering
documents/text of interest from massive amount of texts b) Configurable entity
extraction pipeline: include entity extraction techniques i.e., i) DBpedia
Spotlight, ii) Spacy NER, iii) Custom Entity Matcher, iv) Phrase extraction (or
dictionary) based c) Association Relationship Mining: To generates
co-occurrence graph to analyse potential relationships among entities,
concepts. Further, co-occurrence count based frequency statistics provide a
holistic window to observe association trends or buzz rate in specific business
context. The paper demonstrates the usage of framework as fundamental building
box in two financial use-cases namely brand product discovery and vendor risk
monitoring. We aim that such framework will remove duplicated effort, minimize
the development effort, and encourage reusability and rapid prototyping in
association mining business applications for institutions.

Abstract: Computational models of pragmatic language use have traditionally relied on
hand-specified sets of utterances and meanings, limiting their applicability to
real-world language use. We propose a neuro-symbolic framework that enhances
probabilistic cognitive models by integrating LLM-based modules to propose and
evaluate key components in natural language, eliminating the need for manual
specification. Through a classic case study of pragmatic question-answering, we
systematically examine various approaches to incorporating neural modules into
the cognitive model -- from evaluating utilities and literal semantics to
generating alternative utterances and goals. We find that hybrid models can
match or exceed the performance of traditional probabilistic models in
predicting human answer patterns. However, the success of the neuro-symbolic
model depends critically on how LLMs are integrated: while they are
particularly effective for proposing alternatives and transforming abstract
goals into utilities, they face challenges with truth-conditional semantic
evaluation. This work charts a path toward more flexible and scalable models of
pragmatic language use while illuminating crucial design considerations for
balancing neural and symbolic components.

Abstract: Detoxification, the task of rewriting harmful language into non-toxic text,
has become increasingly important amid the growing prevalence of toxic content
online. However, high-quality parallel datasets for detoxification, especially
for hate speech, remain scarce due to the cost and sensitivity of human
annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-in-the-loop pipeline
leveraging GPT-4o-mini for automated detoxification. We first replicate the
ParaDetox pipeline by replacing human annotators with an LLM and show that the
LLM performs comparably to human annotation. Building on this, we construct
PARADEHATE, a large-scale parallel dataset specifically for hatespeech
detoxification. We release PARADEHATE as a benchmark of over 8K hate/non-hate
text pairs and evaluate a wide range of baseline methods. Experimental results
show that models such as BART, fine-tuned on PARADEHATE, achieve better
performance in style accuracy, content preservation, and fluency, demonstrating
the effectiveness of LLM-generated detoxification text as a scalable
alternative to human annotation.

Conclusion: ACCI在统一框架中有效去偏，无需额外数据增强或启发式过滤，实现了最佳性能。

Abstract: Cross-document Event Coreference Resolution (CD-ECR) is a fundamental task in
natural language processing (NLP) that seeks to determine whether event
mentions across multiple documents refer to the same real-world occurrence.
However, current CD-ECR approaches predominantly rely on trigger features
within input mention pairs, which induce spurious correlations between
surface-level lexical features and coreference relationships, impairing the
overall performance of the models. To address this issue, we propose a novel
cross-document event coreference resolution method based on Argument-Centric
Causal Intervention (ACCI). Specifically, we construct a structural causal
graph to uncover confounding dependencies between lexical triggers and
coreference labels, and introduce backdoor-adjusted interventions to isolate
the true causal effect of argument semantics. To further mitigate spurious
correlations, ACCI integrates a counterfactual reasoning module that quantifies
the causal influence of trigger word perturbations, and an argument-aware
enhancement module to promote greater sensitivity to semantically grounded
information. In contrast to prior methods that depend on costly data
augmentation or heuristic-based filtering, ACCI enables effective debiasing in
a unified end-to-end framework without altering the underlying training
procedure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACCI achieves CoNLL F1 of
88.4% on ECB+ and 85.2% on GVC, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The
implementation and materials are available at https://github.com/era211/ACCI.

Motivation: 探索多语言定义建模的可行性，测试预训练模型和LLM在新语言任务中的表现。

Method: 使用四种语言的单语词典数据，微调预训练多语言模型，并采用零样本方法测试LLM。

Result: 多语言模型表现与英语相当，但无法利用跨语言协同效应；LLM整体表现更优，但存在局限性。

Conclusion: 多语言定义建模任务可作为计算受限、稳定且自然的替代方案，BERTScore与多语言LLM基准表现强相关。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first multilingual study on definition
modeling. We use monolingual dictionary data for four new languages (Spanish,
French, Portuguese, and German) and perform an in-depth empirical study to test
the performance of pre-trained multilingual language models on definition
modeling of monosemic words when finetuned on this data. Furthermore, we use a
zero-shot approach to test the multilingual capabilities of two popular
chat-based Large Language Models (LLMs) in the task. Results show that
multilingual language models can perform on-pair with English but cannot
leverage potential cross-lingual synergies, with LLMs generally offering better
performance overall. A comprehensive human evaluation of the LLM-generated
definition highlights the zero and few-shot capabilities of these models in
this new task, also showing their shortcomings. Finally, we show that
performance on our task via BERTScore strongly correlates to the performance on
multilingual LLM benchmarks, suggesting that our task offers a viable
compute-constrained, stable and natural alternative to these.

*Ping Wu,Guobin Shen,Dongcheng Zhao,Yuwei Wang,Yiting Dong,Yu Shi,Enmeng Lu,Feifei Zhao,Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于中国核心价值观的分层价值框架，并构建了大规模的中国价值观语料库（CVC），用于评估和调整大型语言模型（LLMs）的价值对齐。实验证明CVC在多样性和文化相关性上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs的价值评估和调整受限于西方文化偏见和不完整的本土框架，缺乏可扩展的规则驱动场景生成方法，导致评估成本高且不全面。

Method: 提出分层价值框架，构建包含25万条价值规则的CVC语料库，并通过人工标注增强。生成40万条基于规则的道德困境场景。

Result: CVC生成的场景在价值边界和多样性上优于直接生成的场景。主流LLMs在70.5%的情况下偏好CVC选项，中国人类标注者与CVC的契合度为87.5%。

Conclusion: 研究建立了一个文化适应的基准框架，为全面价值评估和对齐提供了中国特色的解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) align with mainstream human values
and ethical norms is crucial for the safe and sustainable development of AI.
Current value evaluation and alignment are constrained by Western cultural bias
and incomplete domestic frameworks reliant on non-native rules; furthermore,
the lack of scalable, rule-driven scenario generation methods makes evaluations
costly and inadequate across diverse cultural contexts. To address these
challenges, we propose a hierarchical value framework grounded in core Chinese
values, encompassing three main dimensions, 12 core values, and 50 derived
values. Based on this framework, we construct a large-scale Chinese Values
Corpus (CVC) containing over 250,000 value rules enhanced and expanded through
human annotation. Experimental results show that CVC-guided scenarios
outperform direct generation ones in value boundaries and content diversity. In
the evaluation across six sensitive themes (e.g., surrogacy, suicide), seven
mainstream LLMs preferred CVC-generated options in over 70.5% of cases, while
five Chinese human annotators showed an 87.5% alignment with CVC, confirming
its universality, cultural relevance, and strong alignment with Chinese values.
Additionally, we construct 400,000 rule-based moral dilemma scenarios that
objectively capture nuanced distinctions in conflicting value prioritization
across 17 LLMs. Our work establishes a culturally-adaptive benchmarking
framework for comprehensive value evaluation and alignment, representing
Chinese characteristics. All data are available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/Beijing-AISI/CVC, and the code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种连续语音学习框架，通过动态选择任务特征提升语音模型适应性，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态方法无法适应动态多样的语音数据，需解决语音模型的适应性问题。

Method: 使用Whisper编码器-解码器模型，引入可学习的门控融合层动态选择任务特征。

Result: 在六项语音任务中显著提升准确率，无需完全重新训练即可适应新任务。

Conclusion: 连续语音学习框架有效解决了语音模型的动态适应问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Rapid growth in speech data demands adaptive models, as traditional static
methods fail to keep pace with dynamic and diverse speech information. We
introduce continuous speech learning, a new set-up targeting at bridging the
adaptation gap in current speech models. We use the encoder-decoder Whisper
model to standardize speech tasks into a generative format. We integrate a
learnable gated-fusion layer on the top of the encoder to dynamically select
task-specific features for downstream tasks. Our approach improves accuracy
significantly over traditional methods in six speech processing tasks,
demonstrating gains in adapting to new speech tasks without full retraining.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在不确定环境中生成基于事实和信心的表达时的局限性，并评估了LLMs对认知模态的语义知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在生成与证据强度匹配的表达时的不足，特别是对不确定性的理解和表达能力。

Method: 利用类型学框架和受控故事评估LLMs对认知模态的语义知识。

Result: LLMs生成认知表达的能力有限且不稳定，其不确定性表达不可靠。

Conclusion: 为构建不确定性感知的LLMs，需丰富其对认知模态的语义知识。

Abstract: Rational speakers are supposed to know what they know and what they do not
know, and to generate expressions matching the strength of evidence. In
contrast, it is still a challenge for current large language models to generate
corresponding utterances based on the assessment of facts and confidence in an
uncertain real-world environment. While it has recently become popular to
estimate and calibrate confidence of LLMs with verbalized uncertainty, what is
lacking is a careful examination of the linguistic knowledge of uncertainty
encoded in the latent space of LLMs. In this paper, we draw on typological
frameworks of epistemic expressions to evaluate LLMs' knowledge of epistemic
modality, using controlled stories. Our experiments show that the performance
of LLMs in generating epistemic expressions is limited and not robust, and
hence the expressions of uncertainty generated by LLMs are not always reliable.
To build uncertainty-aware LLMs, it is necessary to enrich semantic knowledge
of epistemic modality in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出FormFactory，一个用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在表单填写任务中表现的交互式基准套件，发现当前模型的准确率不足5%，揭示了其在视觉布局推理和字段值对齐方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线表单填写是一项常见但劳动密集的任务，现有工具多为基于规则且缺乏通用生成能力。多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在GUI相关任务中表现出潜力，但在表单填写任务中面临独特挑战。

Method: 提出FormFactory，一个包含Web界面、后端评估模块和精心构建数据集的交互式基准套件，覆盖多样化的真实场景和字段格式。

Result: 对现有MLLMs的评估显示，模型的准确率不足5%，表明其在视觉布局推理和字段值对齐方面存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: FormFactory为研究更鲁棒、实用的表单填写代理提供了基础，揭示了当前模型的不足，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Online form filling is a common yet labor-intensive task involving extensive
keyboard and mouse interactions. Despite the long-standing vision of automating
this process with "one click", existing tools remain largely rule-based and
lack generalizable, generative capabilities. Recent advances in Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled promising agents for GUI-related
tasks in general-purpose scenarios. However, they struggle with the unique
challenges of form filling, such as flexible layouts and the difficulty of
aligning textual instructions with on-screen fields. To bridge this gap, we
formally define the form-filling task and propose FormFactory, an interactive
benchmarking suite comprising a web-based interface, backend evaluation module,
and carefully constructed dataset. Our benchmark covers diverse real-world
scenarios, incorporates various field formats, and simulates high-fidelity form
interactions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs
and observe that no model surpasses 5% accuracy, underscoring the inherent
difficulty of the task. These findings also reveal significant limitations in
current models' visual layout reasoning and field-value alignment abilities. We
hope our benchmark can serve as a stepping stone for further research into
robust, practical form-filling agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于角色扮演和人物特质的对话方法依赖静态描述和低质量合成数据，难以捕捉动态细粒度的人类对话特征。

Method: 提出V-VAE框架，包含变分自编码模块和细粒度控制空间，动态调整对话行为。同时构建高质量数据集HumanChatData和基准测试HumanChatBench。

Result: 实验表明，基于V-VAE的LLM在HumanChatBench和DialogBench上优于标准基线。

Conclusion: V-VAE框架和HumanChatData有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了对话生成的质量和一致性。

Abstract: With the continued proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) based
chatbots, there is a growing demand for generating responses that are not only
linguistically fluent but also consistently aligned with persona-specific
traits in conversations. However, existing role-play and persona-based chat
approaches rely heavily on static role descriptions, coarse-grained signal
space, and low-quality synthetic data, which fail to capture dynamic
fine-grained details in human-like chat. Human-like chat requires modeling
subtle latent traits, such as emotional tone, situational awareness, and
evolving personality, which are difficult to predefine and cannot be easily
learned from synthetic or distillation-based data. To address these
limitations, we propose a Verbal Variational Auto-Encoding (V-VAE) framework,
containing a variational auto-encoding module and fine-grained control space
which dynamically adapts dialogue behaviour based on fine-grained,
interpretable latent variables across talking style, interaction patterns, and
personal attributes. We also construct a high-quality dataset, HumanChatData,
and benchmark HumanChatBench to address the scarcity of high-quality data in
the human-like domain. Experiments show that LLMs based on V-VAE consistently
outperform standard baselines on HumanChatBench and DialogBench, which further
demonstrates the effectiveness of V-VAE and HumanChatData.

Motivation: 现有数学数据集存在内容过时、缺乏挑战性、忽视人类推理和可靠性不足的问题，需要更高质量的数据集。

Method: 采用人类参与的多代理数据生成框架，结合推理密集型过滤器和人类评估，从学术论文中提取数学推导。

Result: 生成的2000个样本中，最难的100个问题连GPT-o1也仅解决不到5%，微调后模型性能显著提升（LLaMA3-8B提升7.84%，Qwen2.5-7B提升9.12%）。

Conclusion: STORM-BORN为AI提供了高难度基准和人类推理训练资源，推动其接近数学家水平。

Abstract: High-quality math datasets are crucial for advancing the reasoning abilities
of large language models (LLMs). However, existing datasets often suffer from
three key issues: outdated and insufficient challenging content, neglecting
human-like reasoning, and limited reliability due to single-LLM generation. To
address these, we introduce $\textbf{STORM-BORN}$, an ultra-challenging dataset
of mathematical derivations sourced from cutting-edge academic papers, which
includes dense human-like approximations and heuristic cues. To ensure the
reliability and quality, we propose a novel human-in-the-loop, multi-agent data
generation framework, integrating reasoning-dense filters, multi-agent
collaboration, and human mathematicians' evaluations. We curated a set of 2,000
synthetic samples and deliberately selected the 100 most difficult problems.
Even most advanced models like GPT-o1 solved fewer than $5\%$ of them.
Fine-tuning on STORM-BORN boosts accuracy by $7.84\%$ (LLaMA3-8B) and $9.12\%$
(Qwen2.5-7B). As AI approaches mathematician-level reasoning, STORM-BORN
provides both a high-difficulty benchmark and a human-like reasoning training
resource. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

Motivation: 现有方法在低资源语言上表现不佳，而双语词典资源丰富，因此探索基于词典的跨语言词汇迁移方法。

Method: 利用BPE分词器的特性，逐步移除目标子词并估计其嵌入，通过双语词典实现词汇迁移。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低资源语言上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 基于双语词典的跨语言词汇迁移方法简单有效，特别适用于低资源语言。

Abstract: Cross-lingual vocabulary transfer plays a promising role in adapting
pre-trained language models to new languages, including low-resource languages.
Existing approaches that utilize monolingual or parallel corpora face
challenges when applied to languages with limited resources. In this work, we
propose a simple yet effective vocabulary transfer method that utilizes
bilingual dictionaries, which are available for many languages, thanks to
descriptive linguists. Our proposed method leverages a property of BPE
tokenizers where removing a subword from the vocabulary causes a fallback to
shorter subwords. The embeddings of target subwords are estimated iteratively
by progressively removing them from the tokenizer. The experimental results
show that our approach outperforms existing methods for low-resource languages,
demonstrating the effectiveness of a dictionary-based approach for
cross-lingual vocabulary transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型的文化理解研究多关注地理多样性，忽视了时间维度，因此需要新的数据集和方法来评估时空文化理解能力。

Method: 引入Hanfu-Bench数据集，包含文化视觉理解和文化图像转创两项任务，分别测试模型对时空文化特征的识别能力和传统元素现代转化的能力。

Result: 封闭式视觉语言模型在文化视觉理解上接近非专家水平，但落后专家10%；开放式模型表现更差。图像转创任务中，最佳模型成功率仅42%。

Conclusion: Hanfu-Bench揭示了时空文化理解和创意适应的重大挑战，为未来研究提供了重要测试平台。

Abstract: Culture is a rich and dynamic domain that evolves across both geography and
time. However, existing studies on cultural understanding with vision-language
models (VLMs) primarily emphasize geographic diversity, often overlooking the
critical temporal dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hanfu-Bench, a
novel, expert-curated multimodal dataset. Hanfu, a traditional garment spanning
ancient Chinese dynasties, serves as a representative cultural heritage that
reflects the profound temporal aspects of Chinese culture while remaining
highly popular in Chinese contemporary society. Hanfu-Bench comprises two core
tasks: cultural visual understanding and cultural image transcreation.The
former task examines temporal-cultural feature recognition based on single- or
multi-image inputs through multiple-choice visual question answering, while the
latter focuses on transforming traditional attire into modern designs through
cultural element inheritance and modern context adaptation. Our evaluation
shows that closed VLMs perform comparably to non-experts on visual cutural
understanding but fall short by 10\% to human experts, while open VLMs lags
further behind non-experts. For the transcreation task, multi-faceted human
evaluation indicates that the best-performing model achieves a success rate of
only 42\%. Our benchmark provides an essential testbed, revealing significant
challenges in this new direction of temporal cultural understanding and
creative adaptation.

Motivation: 探讨提示工程是否足以提升复杂领域（如预测）中大型语言模型的性能。

Method: 测试了38种提示变体，并引入复合提示和外部来源提示，涵盖多种模型（Claude 3.5 Sonnet、GPT-4o等）和推理模型（o1和o1-mini）。

Result: 大多数提示改进效果微弱，仅基准率相关提示略有提升；某些策略（如贝叶斯推理）显著降低准确性。

Conclusion: 在复杂任务中，提示工程改进效果有限，可能需要更强大或专门的技术来显著提升AI预测性能。

Abstract: Large language model performance can be improved in a large number of ways.
Many such techniques, like fine-tuning or advanced tool usage, are
time-intensive and expensive. Although prompt engineering is significantly
cheaper and often works for simpler tasks, it remains unclear whether prompt
engineering suffices for more complex domains like forecasting. Here we show
that small prompt modifications rarely boost forecasting accuracy beyond a
minimal baseline. In our first study, we tested 38 prompts across Claude 3.5
Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT-4o, and Llama 3.1 405B. In our second, we
introduced compound prompts and prompts from external sources, also including
the reasoning models o1 and o1-mini. Our results show that most prompts lead to
negligible gains, although references to base rates yield slight benefits.
Surprisingly, some strategies showed strong negative effects on accuracy:
especially encouraging the model to engage in Bayesian reasoning. These results
suggest that, in the context of complex tasks like forecasting, basic prompt
refinements alone offer limited gains, implying that more robust or specialized
techniques may be required for substantial performance improvements in AI
forecasting.

Method: 开发了一个公开的乌尔都语假新闻数据集，并评估了多种预训练大语言模型（如XLNet、mBERT等），提出了一种统一的LLM模型。

Result: 提出的统一LLM模型在准确性、F1分数等指标上优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发可靠、专家验证的乌尔都语假新闻数据集的重要性，为资源匮乏语言的假新闻检测提供了新方法。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of social media platforms has significantly increased the
dissemination of forged content and misinformation, making the detection of
fake news a critical area of research. Although fact-checking efforts
predominantly focus on English-language news, there is a noticeable gap in
resources and strategies to detect news in regional languages, such as Urdu.
Advanced Fake News Detection (FND) techniques rely heavily on large, accurately
labeled datasets. However, FND in under-resourced languages like Urdu faces
substantial challenges due to the scarcity of extensive corpora and the lack of
validated lexical resources. Current Urdu fake news datasets are often
domain-specific and inaccessible to the public. They also lack human
verification, relying mainly on unverified English-to-Urdu translations, which
compromises their reliability in practical applications. This study highlights
the necessity of developing reliable, expert-verified, and domain-independent
Urdu-enhanced FND datasets to improve fake news detection in Urdu and other
resource-constrained languages. This paper presents the first benchmark large
FND dataset for Urdu news, which is publicly available for validation and deep
analysis. We also evaluate this dataset using multiple state-of-the-art
pre-trained large language models (LLMs), such as XLNet, mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa,
RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and DeBERTa. Additionally, we propose a unified LLM model
that outperforms the others with different embedding and feature extraction
techniques. The performance of these models is compared based on accuracy, F1
score, precision, recall, and human judgment for vetting the sample results of
news.

Motivation: 编码器模型在计算和内存成本上优于LLMs，但在零样本任务中表现较差。研究旨在探索编码器模型是否能在多语言任务中实现零样本泛化，并成为低资源语言的高效替代方案。

Method: 采用Statement Tuning方法，将任务重新表述为有限模板，并扩展至多语言NLP任务，分析其泛化能力和效率。

Result: 实验表明，编码器模型在多语言任务中表现优异，与多语言LLMs相当，同时更高效。

Conclusion: 研究证明了编码器模型在多语言零样本任务中的潜力，为资源高效和包容性NLP模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in zero-shot and few-shot tasks, but
achieving similar performance with encoder-only models like BERT and RoBERTa
has been challenging due to their architecture. However, encoders offer
advantages such as lower computational and memory costs. Recent work adapts
them for zero-shot generalization using Statement Tuning, which reformulates
tasks into finite templates. We extend this approach to multilingual NLP,
exploring whether encoders can achieve zero-shot cross-lingual generalization
and serve as efficient alternatives to memory-intensive LLMs for low-resource
languages. Our results show that state-of-the-art encoder models generalize
well across languages, rivaling multilingual LLMs while being more efficient.
We also analyze multilingual Statement Tuning dataset design, efficiency gains,
and language-specific generalization, contributing to more inclusive and
resource-efficient NLP models. We release our code and models.

Method: 通过手动翻译MS MARCO-dev集的1000个查询创建IndicMSMarco基准，并利用LLM从19种印度语言的维基百科构建训练数据集。

Result: 开发了IndicMSMarco基准和包含多种印度语言的大规模训练数据集。

Conclusion: 这些资源填补了印度语言在RAG系统中的空白，为未来研究提供了支持。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable language models to access
relevant information and generate accurate, well-grounded, and contextually
informed responses. However, for Indian languages, the development of
high-quality RAG systems is hindered by the lack of two critical resources: (1)
evaluation benchmarks for retrieval and generation tasks, and (2) large-scale
training datasets for multilingual retrieval. Most existing benchmarks and
datasets are centered around English or high-resource languages, making it
difficult to extend RAG capabilities to the diverse linguistic landscape of
India. To address the lack of evaluation benchmarks, we create IndicMSMarco, a
multilingual benchmark for evaluating retrieval quality and response generation
in 13 Indian languages, created via manual translation of 1000 diverse queries
from MS MARCO-dev set. To address the need for training data, we build a
large-scale dataset of (question, answer, relevant passage) tuples derived from
the Wikipedias of 19 Indian languages using state-of-the-art LLMs.
Additionally, we include translated versions of the original MS MARCO dataset
to further enrich the training data and ensure alignment with real-world
information-seeking tasks. Resources are available here:

Conclusion: 提出的词嵌入增强模型显著提升了分类性能，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models such as BERT have been proved to be powerful in
many natural language processing tasks. But in some text classification
applications such as emotion recognition and sentiment analysis, BERT may not
lead to satisfactory performance. This often happens in applications where
keywords play critical roles in the prediction of class labels. Our
investigation found that the root cause of the problem is that the
context-based BERT embedding of the keywords may not be discriminative enough
to produce discriminative text representation for classification. Motivated by
this finding, we develop a method to enhance word embeddings using
domain-specific lexical knowledge. The knowledge-based embedding enhancement
model projects the BERT embedding into a new space where within-class
similarity and between-class difference are maximized. To implement the
knowledge-based word embedding enhancement model, we also develop a knowledge
acquisition algorithm for automatically collecting lexical knowledge from
online open sources. Experiment results on three classification tasks,
including sentiment analysis, emotion recognition and question answering, have
shown the effectiveness of our proposed word embedding enhancing model. The

Method: 开发MVAN模型，结合文本语义注意力和传播结构注意力，捕捉推文内容和传播结构信息。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上，MVAN比现有方法平均准确率提高2.5%，并提供合理解释。

Conclusion: MVAN在短文本假新闻检测中表现优异，且能识别关键线索和可疑用户。

Abstract: Fake news on social media is a widespread and serious problem in today's
society. Existing fake news detection methods focus on finding clues from Long
text content, such as original news articles and user comments. This paper
solves the problem of fake news detection in more realistic scenarios. Only
source shot-text tweet and its retweet users are provided without user
comments. We develop a novel neural network based model,
\textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{N}etworks (MVAN) to
detect fake news and provide explanations on social media. The MVAN model
includes text semantic attention and propagation structure attention, which
ensures that our model can capture information and clues both of source tweet
content and propagation structure. In addition, the two attention mechanisms in
the model can find key clue words in fake news texts and suspicious users in
the propagation structure. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets,
and the results demonstrate that MVAN can significantly outperform
state-of-the-art methods by 2.5\% in accuracy on average, and produce a
reasonable explanation.

*Frederick Riemenschneider,Anette Frank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多语言模型（MLLMs）在无显式跨语言监督的情况下表现出知识迁移能力。研究发现，模型参数空间在预训练中逐渐从语言特定表示压缩为跨语言抽象，神经元逐步对齐跨语言语义概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多语言模型如何在无显式监督下实现跨语言知识迁移，以及其表示空间在预训练中的演化规律。

Method: 分析三个MLLMs的参数空间，通过探测实验观察层功能变化，追踪语义概念神经元的跨语言对齐过程。

Result: 模型从语言特定表示逐步收敛为跨语言抽象，部分神经元成为跨语言概念的可靠预测器。

Conclusion: MLLMs通过预训练自然形成跨语言表示，神经元对齐揭示了其知识迁移的机制。

Abstract: Multilingual language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities
to transfer knowledge across languages, despite being trained without explicit
cross-lingual supervision. We analyze the parameter spaces of three MLLMs to
study how their representations evolve during pre-training, observing patterns
consistent with compression: models initially form language-specific
representations, which gradually converge into cross-lingual abstractions as
training progresses. Through probing experiments, we observe a clear transition
from uniform language identification capabilities across layers to more
specialized layer functions. For deeper analysis, we focus on neurons that
encode distinct semantic concepts. By tracing their development during
pre-training, we show how they gradually align across languages. Notably, we
identify specific neurons that emerge as increasingly reliable predictors for
the same concepts across languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ESGenius是一个评估和提升大语言模型（LLM）在环境、社会和治理（ESG）及可持续性问题回答能力的综合基准，包含QA数据集和语料库，并通过零样本和RAG方法验证模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为LLM在ESG和可持续性领域的表现提供评估标准，并探索提升模型性能的方法。

Method: 开发了ESGenius-QA（多选问题集）和ESGenius-Corpus（权威文档库），采用零样本和RAG两阶段评估协议测试50个LLM。

Result: 零样本下模型表现中等（55-70%），RAG显著提升性能（如某模型从63.82%升至80.46%）。

Conclusion: ESGenius是首个专注于ESG的LLM基准，强调基于权威来源的RAG方法对提升模型理解的重要性。

Abstract: We introduce ESGenius, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating and enhancing
the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Environmental, Social and
Governance (ESG) and sustainability-focused question answering. ESGenius
comprises two key components: (i) ESGenius-QA, a collection of 1 136
multiple-choice questions generated by LLMs and rigorously validated by domain
experts, covering a broad range of ESG pillars and sustainability topics. Each
question is systematically linked to its corresponding source text, enabling
transparent evaluation and supporting retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
methods; and (ii) ESGenius-Corpus, a meticulously curated repository of 231
foundational frameworks, standards, reports and recommendation documents from
seven authoritative sources. Moreover, to fully assess the capabilities and
adaptation potential of the model, we implement a rigorous two-stage evaluation
protocol -- Zero-Shot and RAG. Extensive experiments across 50 LLMs (ranging
from 0.5 B to 671 B parameters) demonstrate that state-of-the-art models
achieve only moderate performance in zero-shot settings, with accuracies
typically around 55--70\%, highlighting ESGenius's challenging nature for LLMs
in interdisciplinary contexts. However, models employing RAG show significant
performance improvements, particularly for smaller models. For example,
"DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B" improves from 63.82\% (zero-shot) to 80.46\%
with RAG. These results underscore the necessity of grounding responses in
authoritative sources for enhanced ESG understanding. To the best of our
knowledge, ESGenius is the first benchmark curated for LLMs and the relevant
enhancement technologies that focuses on ESG and sustainability topics.

*Chen Zhang,Zhiyuan Liao,Yansong Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型在多语言环境中文化知识获取的机制，发现高资源语言与英语之间存在双向文化传递，而低资源语言主要向英语单向传递。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有大量研究评估大型语言模型处理全球文化多样性的能力，但其在多语言环境中文化知识获取的机制仍不明确。

Method: 引入了一个可解释的框架，研究文化知识在语言适应过程中的传递，并控制传递效应。通过研究四种非英语文化，分析了双向与单向传递现象。

Result: 观察到高资源语言与英语之间存在双向文化传递，而低资源语言主要向英语单向传递。提出频率假设，认为文化知识在预训练数据中出现频率越高，传递越容易。

Conclusion: 文化知识的传递与语言资源丰富度及数据频率相关，为理解多语言模型的文化知识获取提供了新视角。

Abstract: Despite substantial research efforts evaluating how well large language
models~(LLMs) handle global cultural diversity, the mechanisms behind their
cultural knowledge acquisition, particularly in multilingual settings, remain
unclear. We study this question by investigating how cultural knowledge
transfers across languages during language adaptation of LLMs. We introduce an
interpretable framework for studying this transfer, ensuring training data
transparency and controlling transfer effects. Through a study of four
non-Anglophonic cultures, we observe bidirectional cultural transfer between
English and other high-resource languages, while low-resource languages
primarily transfer knowledge to English with limited reverse flow. To explain
this asymmetric phenomenon, we propose a frequency-based hypothesis: cultural
knowledge appearing more frequently in the pretraining data transfers more
easily, which is supported by empirical analysis of the training corpora.

### [202] [StochasTok: Improving Fine-Grained Subword Understanding in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01687)
*Anya Sims,Thom Foster,Klara Kaleb,Tuan-Duy H. Nguyen,Joseph Lee,Jakob N. Foerster,Yee Whye Teh,Cong Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为StochasTok的随机分词方法，通过随机分割训练时的token，帮助大语言模型（LLMs）更好地理解子词结构，显著提升了在子词级任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在子词级任务（如字符计数、子串识别等）上表现不佳，主要原因是分词方式掩盖了单词的细粒度结构。现有替代方法（如字符级分词）计算成本高且效果不稳定。

Method: 引入StochasTok，一种简单高效的随机分词方案，在训练时随机分割token，使模型能够‘看到’单词的内部结构。

Result: 实验表明，使用StochasTok预训练显著提升了LLMs在字符计数、子串识别和数学任务等子词级任务上的表现。此外，StochasTok还可用于现有模型的微调，避免从头预训练的高成本。

Conclusion: StochasTok通过简单的改进实现了显著效果，展示了在更大模型上应用的潜力。代码已开源。

Abstract: Subword-level understanding is integral to numerous tasks, including
understanding multi-digit numbers, spelling mistakes, abbreviations, rhyming,
and wordplay. Despite this, current large language models (LLMs) still often
struggle with seemingly simple subword-level tasks like How many 'r's in
'strawberry'?. A key factor behind these failures is tokenization which
obscures the fine-grained structure of words. Current alternatives, such as
character-level and dropout tokenization methods, significantly increase
computational costs and provide inconsistent improvements. In this paper we
revisit tokenization and introduce StochasTok, a simple, efficient stochastic
tokenization scheme that randomly splits tokens during training, allowing LLMs
to 'see' their internal structure. Our experiments show that pretraining with
StochasTok substantially improves LLMs' downstream performance across multiple
subword-level language games, including character counting, substring
identification, and math tasks. Furthermore, StochasTok's simplicity allows
seamless integration at any stage of the training pipeline; and we demonstrate
that post-training with StochasTok can instill improved subword understanding
into existing pretrained models, thus avoiding costly pretraining from scratch.
These dramatic improvements achieved with a minimal change suggest StochasTok
holds exciting potential when applied to larger, more capable models. Code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文综述了基于大型语言模型（LLM）的协作系统在情感计算（AC）中的应用，探讨了从结构化协作到自主协作的方法，并分析了其潜力与挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的情感计算任务在自然语言处理中采用流水线架构，存在结构僵化问题，而LLM提供了统一的方法，但其在情感推理中存在认知限制。论文旨在通过协作系统解决这些问题。

Method: 系统回顾现有方法，比较协作策略，分析实验数据，并讨论关键功能与应用。

Result: 协作系统能增强情感推理的鲁棒性和适应性，但仍面临文化差异和幻觉问题等挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究为情感计算领域提供了协作智能的新方向，有望实现更接近人类社交智能的应用。

Abstract: Affective Computing (AC) is essential in bridging the gap between human
emotional experiences and machine understanding. Traditionally, AC tasks in
natural language processing (NLP) have been approached through pipeline
architectures, which often suffer from structure rigidity that leads to
inefficiencies and limited adaptability. The advent of Large Language Models
(LLMs) has revolutionized this field by offering a unified approach to
affective understanding and generation tasks, enhancing the potential for
dynamic, real-time interactions. However, LLMs face cognitive limitations in
affective reasoning, such as misinterpreting cultural nuances or contextual
emotions, and hallucination problems in decision-making. To address these
challenges, recent research advocates for LLM-based collaboration systems that
emphasize interactions among specialized models and LLMs, mimicking human-like
affective intelligence through the synergy of emotional and rational thinking
that aligns with Dual Process Theory in psychology. This survey aims to provide
a comprehensive overview of LLM-based collaboration systems in AC, exploring
from structured collaborations to autonomous collaborations. Specifically, it
includes: (1) A systematic review of existing methods, focusing on
collaboration strategies, mechanisms, key functions, and applications; (2)
Experimental comparisons of collaboration strategies across representative
tasks in affective understanding and generation; (3) An analysis highlighting
the potential of these systems to enhance robustness and adaptability in
complex affective reasoning; (4) A discussion of key challenges and future
research directions to further advance the field. This work is the first to
systematically explore collaborative intelligence with LLMs in AC, paving the
way for more powerful applications that approach human-like social
intelligence.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于微调较小LLMs的文本分类方法（mdok），用于检测机器生成的文本，并在Voight-Kampff Generative AI Detection 2025任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）生成的高质量文本可能被滥用（如抄袭、垃圾信息、虚假信息传播），需要自动化检测方法。然而，现有方法对分布外数据的鲁棒性仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用微调较小LLMs的文本分类方法（mdok），应用于Voight-Kampff Generative AI Detection 2025的两个子任务。

Result: 在二元检测和多类分类（人类-AI协作的多种情况）中表现优异，多类分类排名第一。

Conclusion: mdok方法在检测机器生成文本方面具有鲁棒性和高效性，尤其在多类分类任务中表现突出。

Abstract: The large language models (LLMs) are able to generate high-quality texts in
multiple languages. Such texts are often not recognizable by humans as
generated, and therefore present a potential of LLMs for misuse (e.g.,
plagiarism, spams, disinformation spreading). An automated detection is able to
assist humans to indicate the machine-generated texts; however, its robustness
to out-of-distribution data is still challenging. This notebook describes our
mdok approach in robust detection, based on fine-tuning smaller LLMs for text
classification. It is applied to both subtasks of Voight-Kampff Generative AI
Detection 2025, providing remarkable performance in binary detection as well as
in multiclass (1st rank) classification of various cases of human-AI
collaboration.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）训练中的公平性动态，提出两种新指标评估偏见，发现偏见可能突然出现且与性能指标无关，通过早期停止可显著提升公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 诊断和缓解LLM训练中的偏见，探索公平性与性能的权衡。

Method: 引入两种新指标（Average Rank和Jensen-Shannon Divergence by Parts）评估Pythia模型在WinoBias数据集上的性别偏见动态。

Result: Pythia-6.9b对男性偏见明显，早期停止可牺牲少量准确率大幅提升公平性，更大模型偏见更严重。

Conclusion: 公平性动态监测有助于偏见干预，早期停止是有效策略，模型规模可能加剧偏见。

Abstract: We investigate fairness dynamics during Large Language Model (LLM) training
to enable the diagnoses of biases and mitigations through training
interventions like early stopping; we find that biases can emerge suddenly and
do not always follow common performance metrics. We introduce two new metrics
to evaluate fairness dynamics holistically during model pre-training: Average
Rank and Jensen-Shannon Divergence by Parts. These metrics provide insights
into the Pythia models' progression of biases in gender prediction of
occupations on the WinoBias dataset. By monitoring these dynamics, we find that
(1) Pythia-6.9b is biased towards men; it becomes more performant and confident
predicting "male" than "female" during training, (2) via early-stopping,
Pythia-6.9b can exchange 1.7% accuracy on LAMBADA for a 92.5% increase in
fairness, and (3) larger models can exhibit more bias; Pythia-6.9b makes more
assumptions about gender than Pythia-160m, even when a subject's gender is not
specified.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习（RL）的表格推理方法Reasoning-Table，通过数据预处理、奖励设计和训练策略优化，在多个基准测试中超越监督微调（SFT），并展现了更强的泛化能力和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调方法在表格推理任务中存在泛化和鲁棒性问题，受限于模仿学习的固有偏差。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，结合数据预处理、奖励设计和定制化训练策略，利用基于规则的简单奖励优化模型性能。

Result: 在表格推理基准测试中超越SFT方法，性能优于Claude-3.7-Sonnet等大型专有模型4.0%，在BIRD开发集上达到68.3%的文本到SQL任务性能。

Conclusion: Reasoning-Table通过强化学习显著提升了表格推理任务的性能、泛化能力和鲁棒性，成为首个在该领域应用RL并取得最优效果的方法。

Abstract: Table reasoning, encompassing tasks such as table question answering, fact
verification, and text-to-SQL, requires precise understanding of structured
tabular data, coupled with numerical computation and code manipulation for
effective inference. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches have achieved
notable success but often struggle with generalization and robustness due to
biases inherent in imitative learning. We introduce Reasoning-Table, the first
application of reinforcement learning (RL) to table reasoning, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Through rigorous data preprocessing, reward
design, and tailored training strategies, our method leverages simple
rule-based outcome rewards to outperform SFT across multiple benchmarks.
Unified training across diverse tasks enables Reasoning-Table to emerge as a
robust table reasoning large language model, surpassing larger proprietary
models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet by 4.0% on table reasoning benchmarks. The
approach also achieves excellent performance on text-to-SQL tasks, reaching
68.3% performance on the BIRD dev dataset with a 7B model. Further experiments
demonstrate that Reasoning-Table enhances the model's generalization
capabilities and robustness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SRPO的两阶段反思增强强化学习框架，旨在提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的推理能力。通过构建高质量的反思数据集和引入新颖的奖励机制，SRPO显著提升了推理准确性和反思质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，尤其是缺乏有效的自我反思和自我纠正能力。现有方法生成的反馈简单且缺乏指导性。

Method: 提出SRPO框架，分为两阶段：1）构建高质量的反思数据集；2）在GRPO框架中引入奖励机制，鼓励简洁且有意义的反思。

Result: 在多个多模态推理基准测试中，SRPO显著优于现有模型，推理准确性和反思质量均有显著提升。

Conclusion: SRPO通过反思增强的强化学习框架，有效提升了多模态大语言模型的推理能力，为复杂任务提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising capabilities in
reasoning tasks, yet still struggle with complex problems requiring explicit
self-reflection and self-correction, especially compared to their unimodal
text-based counterparts. Existing reflection methods are simplistic and
struggle to generate meaningful and instructive feedback, as the reasoning
ability and knowledge limits of pre-trained models are largely fixed during
initial training. To overcome these challenges, we propose Multimodal
Self-Reflection enhanced reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(SRPO), a two-stage reflection-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework
explicitly designed to enhance multimodal LLM reasoning. In the first stage, we
construct a high-quality, reflection-focused dataset under the guidance of an
advanced MLLM, which generates reflections based on initial responses to help
the policy model learn both reasoning and self-reflection. In the second stage,
we introduce a novel reward mechanism within the GRPO framework that encourages
concise and cognitively meaningful reflection while avoiding redundancy.
Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks,
including MathVista, MathVision, MathVerse, and MMMU-Pro, using Qwen-2.5-VL-7B
and Qwen-2.5-VL-32B demonstrate that SRPO significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models, achieving notable improvements in both reasoning
accuracy and reflection quality.

Motivation: 习语的比喻意义与字面意义差异显著，模型需学习如何区分和选择这两种意义，研究旨在揭示模型内部如何处理这一挑战。

Method: 使用机制解释性工具分析LLama3.2-1B-base模型，定位了习语处理的三个步骤：比喻意义检索、注意力头作用及并行路径处理。

Result: 发现特定注意力头促进比喻意义并抑制字面意义，模型通过中间路径表示比喻意义，同时保留字面解释的并行路径。

Conclusion: 研究为自回归变换器中习语理解的机制提供了证据，揭示了模型处理习语歧义的具体方式。

Abstract: Idioms present a unique challenge for language models due to their
non-compositional figurative meanings, which often strongly diverge from the
idiom's literal interpretation. This duality requires a model to learn
representing and deciding between the two meanings to interpret an idiom in a
figurative sense, or literally. In this paper, we employ tools from mechanistic
interpretability to trace how a large pretrained causal transformer
(LLama3.2-1B-base) deals with this ambiguity. We localize three steps of idiom
processing: First, the idiom's figurative meaning is retrieved in early
attention and MLP sublayers. We identify specific attention heads which boost
the figurative meaning of the idiom while suppressing the idiom's literal
interpretation. The model subsequently represents the figurative representation
through an intermediate path. Meanwhile, a parallel bypass route forwards
literal interpretation, ensuring that a both reading remain available. Overall,
our findings provide a mechanistic evidence for idiom comprehension in an
autoregressive transformer.

Result: Common Corpus已成为行业领导者（如Anthropic）和多个LLM训练项目的关键基础设施，支持多样化的研究和商业需求。

Conclusion: Common Corpus将为LLM的开放科学研究提供重要支持，并成为未来研究和应用的基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are pre-trained on large amounts of data from
different sources and domains. These data most often contain trillions of
tokens with large portions of copyrighted or proprietary content, which hinders
the usage of such models under AI legislation. This raises the need for truly
open pre-training data that is compliant with the data security regulations. In
this paper, we introduce Common Corpus, the largest open dataset for language
model pre-training. The data assembled in Common Corpus are either
uncopyrighted or under permissible licenses and amount to about two trillion
tokens. The dataset contains a wide variety of languages, ranging from the main
European languages to low-resource ones rarely present in pre-training
datasets; in addition, it includes a large portion of code data. The diversity
of data sources in terms of covered domains and time periods opens up the paths
for both research and entrepreneurial needs in diverse areas of knowledge. In
this technical report, we present the detailed provenance of data assembling
and the details of dataset filtering and curation. Being already used by such
industry leaders as Anthropic and multiple LLM training projects, we believe
that Common Corpus will become a critical infrastructure for open science
research in LLMs.

*Jiandong Shao,Yao Lu,Jianfei Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）在数值任务中存在基于Benford定律的偏差，并提出通过修剪特定神经元来缓解问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但在基础数值问题上常出错，研究假设这与预训练数据中数字分布的长尾特性有关。

Method: 通过分析预训练数据（OLMo2）是否符合Benford定律，构建均匀分布的数字基准测试，并利用logit-lens和神经元级分析定位偏差来源。

Result: 开源LLMs表现出与Benford定律一致的数字偏差，偏差主要源于深层网络中的少数高度数字选择性神经元。

Conclusion: 修剪特定神经元可减轻偏差，揭示了预训练数据统计与模型行为之间的关联，为数值任务中的幻觉问题提供了新诊断方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks, yet they frequently fail on basic numerical problems,
producing incorrect outputs. Inspired by Benford's Law -- a statistical pattern
where lower digits occur more frequently as leading digits -- we hypothesize
that the long-tailed digit distributions in web-collected corpora may be
learned by LLMs during pretraining, leading to biased numerical generation. To
investigate the hypothesis, we first examine whether digits frequencies in
pretraining corpus (OLMo2) follows Benford's law. We then construct an
evaluation benchmark with uniformly distributed ground-truth digits across
seven numerical reasoning tasks. Our evaluation results demonstrate that
leading open-source LLMs show a consistent pattern of digit bias that resembles
Benford's law. Through logit-lens tracing and neuron-level dissection, we
identify that this bias arises predominantly from a small subset of highly
digit-selective feed-forward network (FFN) neurons in the deeper layers.
Finally, we demonstrate that pruning these neurons mitigates imbalanced
overgeneration and partially corrects erroneous outputs, providing causal
evidence that fine-grained pretraining digit bias can propagate into model
behavior. Our findings reveal a fundamental connection between corpus-level
statistics and symbolic failure modes in LLMs, offering a new lens for
diagnosing and mitigating hallucinations in numerical tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于显式对话数据构建的RPAs缺乏深层次的人类内部思维过程，导致表达浅显。Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) 直接应用时存在注意力分散和风格漂移问题。

Method: 提出RAR方法，包括RIA（通过角色档案引导模型）和RSO（通过LRM蒸馏优化推理风格）。

Result: 实验表明，RAR显著提升了RPAs的性能，有效解决了注意力分散和风格漂移问题。

Conclusion: RAR方法为RPAs提供了更深入、更一致的推理能力，提升了其在情感陪伴和虚拟交互中的应用效果。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred significant
interest in Role-Playing Agents (RPAs) for applications such as emotional
companionship and virtual interaction. However, recent RPAs are often built on
explicit dialogue data, lacking deep, human-like internal thought processes,
resulting in superficial knowledge and style expression. While Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) can be employed to simulate character thought, their direct
application is hindered by attention diversion (i.e., RPAs forget their role)
and style drift (i.e., overly formal and rigid reasoning rather than
character-consistent reasoning). To address these challenges, this paper
introduces a novel Role-Aware Reasoning (RAR) method, which consists of two
important stages: Role Identity Activation (RIA) and Reasoning Style
Optimization (RSO). RIA explicitly guides the model with character profiles
during reasoning to counteract attention diversion, and then RSO aligns
reasoning style with the character and scene via LRM distillation to mitigate
style drift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RAR
significantly enhances the performance of RPAs by effectively addressing
attention diversion and style drift.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用最新OCR技术对Kwak'wala语言的图像文本进行数字化处理，以支持语言复兴和技术开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kwak'wala是一种濒危的土著语言，已有大量文献但未数字化，阻碍了现代语言技术的应用。

Method: 结合现成OCR技术、语言识别、掩码技术及后校正模型，提高转录质量。

Result: 成功实现了对Kwak'wala文本的高质量转录。

Conclusion: 该方法为其他濒危语言的数字化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Kwak'wala is an Indigenous language spoken in British Columbia, with a rich
legacy of published documentation spanning more than a century, and an active
community of speakers, teachers, and learners engaged in language
revitalization. Over 11 volumes of the earliest texts created during the
collaboration between Franz Boas and George Hunt have been scanned but remain
unreadable by machines. Complete digitization through optical character
recognition has the potential to facilitate transliteration into modern
orthographies and the creation of other language technologies. In this paper,
we apply the latest OCR techniques to a series of Kwak'wala texts only
accessible as images, and discuss the challenges and unique adaptations
necessary to make such technologies work for these real-world texts. Building
on previous methods, we propose using a mix of off-the-shelf OCR methods,
language identification, and masking to effectively isolate Kwak'wala text,
along with post-correction models, to produce a final high-quality
transcription.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法多关注单语言场景，忽略了多语言和跨语言环境中的挑战，MaXIFE旨在填补这一空白。

Method: MaXIFE结合规则评估和模型评估，评估了多个商业和开源LLMs。

Result: 建立了多语言指令跟随的基线结果，为未来研究提供参考。

Conclusion: MaXIFE通过标准化工具推动了自然语言处理的研究与发展。

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in natural language
processing, the ability to follow instructions has emerged as a key metric for
evaluating their practical utility. However, existing evaluation methods often
focus on single-language scenarios, overlooking the challenges and differences
present in multilingual and cross-lingual contexts. To address this gap, we
introduce MaXIFE: a comprehensive evaluation benchmark designed to assess
instruction-following capabilities across 23 languages with 1,667 verifiable
instruction tasks. MaXIFE integrates both Rule-Based Evaluation and Model-Based
Evaluation, ensuring a balance of efficiency and accuracy. We applied MaXIFE to
evaluate several leading commercial and open-source LLMs, establishing baseline
results for future comparisons. By providing a standardized tool for
multilingual instruction-following evaluation, MaXIFE aims to advance research
and development in natural language processing.

*Shuai Wang,Yinan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: iQUEST框架通过迭代分解复杂查询和引入GNN增强多跳推理，显著提升KBQA任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在知识密集型任务中存在事实不准确问题，需结合外部知识资源（如知识图谱）提升可靠性。

Method: 提出iQUEST框架，迭代分解复杂查询为子问题，并集成GNN以提前考虑2跳邻居信息。

Result: 在四个基准数据集和四种LLMs上，iQUEST均表现出稳定改进。

Conclusion: iQUEST通过结构化推理路径和多跳信息整合，有效解决了KBQA中的多跳推理挑战。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many natural language processing
tasks, they often suffer from factual inaccuracies in knowledge-intensive
scenarios. Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge
graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable
reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons
over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries.
However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent
reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop
connections. To address these issues, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided
KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler
sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory.
Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and
incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual
approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore
viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent
improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种以人为中心的评估框架（HCE），通过主观维度（问题解决能力、信息质量和交互体验）评估基础模型，填补了传统客观评估的不足。实验涉及多个模型，结果显示Grok 3表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型的评估主要依赖客观指标，忽略了真实的人类体验。本文旨在填补这一空白，提出更全面的主观评估方法。

Method: 采用HCE框架，通过540多次参与者驱动的评估，人类与模型协作完成开放式研究任务，生成主观数据集。

Result: 实验显示Grok 3表现最优，其次是Deepseek R1和Gemini 2.5，OpenAI o3 mini表现较差。

Conclusion: HCE框架和数据集为标准化、自动化的主观评估奠定了基础，推动了LLM在研究和实践中的发展。

Abstract: Currently, nearly all evaluations of foundation models focus on objective
metrics, emphasizing quiz performance to define model capabilities. While this
model-centric approach enables rapid performance assessment, it fails to
reflect authentic human experiences. To address this gap, we propose a
Human-Centric subjective Evaluation (HCE) framework, focusing on three core
dimensions: problem-solving ability, information quality, and interaction
experience. Through experiments involving Deepseek R1, OpenAI o3 mini, Grok 3,
and Gemini 2.5, we conduct over 540 participant-driven evaluations, where
humans and models collaborate on open-ended research tasks, yielding a
comprehensive subjective dataset. This dataset captures diverse user feedback
across multiple disciplines, revealing distinct model strengths and
adaptability. Our findings highlight Grok 3's superior performance, followed by
Deepseek R1 and Gemini 2.5, with OpenAI o3 mini lagging behind. By offering a
novel framework and a rich dataset, this study not only enhances subjective
evaluation methodologies but also lays the foundation for standardized,
automated assessments, advancing LLM development for research and practical
scenarios. Our dataset link is

Motivation: 探讨语法书在极低资源语言翻译中的有效性，尤其是语法规则检索和应用的瓶颈问题。

Method: 将语法规则分解为检索和应用两步，引入ZhuangRules数据集，并提出用代码函数表示语法规则。

Result: 实验表明，代码规则显著提升了规则检索和应用，翻译BLEU分数提高了13.1%。

Conclusion: 代码函数表示语法规则能有效解决LLM在复杂规则处理中的困难，提升翻译效果。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in translating
extremely low-resource languages using resources like dictionaries, the
effectiveness of grammar books remains debated. This paper investigates the
role of grammar books in translating extremely low-resource languages by
decomposing it into two key steps: grammar rule retrieval and application. To
facilitate the study, we introduce ZhuangRules, a modularized dataset of
grammar rules and their corresponding test sentences. Our analysis reveals that
rule retrieval constitutes a primary bottleneck in grammar-based translation.
Moreover, although LLMs can apply simple rules for translation when explicitly
provided, they encounter difficulties in handling more complex rules. To
address these challenges, we propose representing grammar rules as code
functions, considering their similarities in structure and the benefit of code
in facilitating LLM reasoning. Our experiments show that using code rules
significantly boosts both rule retrieval and application, ultimately resulting
in a 13.1% BLEU improvement in translation.

Motivation: 研究社交媒体在乌克兰冲突中的信息战作用，揭示宣传与可信账户的不同传播策略及其对公众认知的影响。

Method: 收集2022年2月至5月的40,000条推文，结合NLP、机器学习和人工分析，评估情感、主题和叙事。

Result: 宣传账户使用情绪化语言和虚假信息，西方账户侧重事实和人道主义；聚类分析显示疑似协同行为。

Conclusion: 研究为信息战动态提供见解，并为未来社交媒体在军事冲突中的影响研究提供方法。

Abstract: The conflict in Ukraine has been not only characterised by military
engagement but also by a significant information war, with social media
platforms like X, formerly known as Twitter playing an important role in
shaping public perception. This article provides an analysis of tweets from
propaganda accounts and trusted accounts collected from the onset of the war,
February 2022 until the middle of May 2022 with n=40,000 total tweets. We
utilise natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to assess
the sentiment and identify key themes, topics and narratives across the dataset
with human-in-the-loop (HITL) analysis throughout. Our findings indicate
distinct strategies in how information is created, spread, and targeted at
different audiences by both sides. Propaganda accounts frequently employ
emotionally charged language and disinformation to evoke fear and distrust,
whereas other accounts, primarily Western tend to focus on factual reporting
and humanitarian aspects of the conflict. Clustering analysis reveals groups of
accounts with similar behaviours, which we suspect indicates the presence of
coordinated efforts. This research attempts to contribute to our understanding
of the dynamics of information warfare and offers techniques for future studies
on social media influence in military conflicts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了PRC对齐的DeepSeek-R1和非PRC对齐的ChatGPT o3-mini-high在宣传和反美情绪上的偏差，发现DeepSeek-R1在简体中文中表现出显著更高的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的意识形态中立性日益受到关注，但缺乏对不同地缘政治对齐模型的跨语言比较研究。

Method: 开发了1200个去语境化的问题语料库，通过GPT-4o评分和人工标注评估两种模型的回答。

Result: DeepSeek-R1在简体中文中表现出更高的宣传和反美偏见，而ChatGPT o3-mini-high则较为中立。

Conclusion: LLMs的偏见不仅限于政治话题，还渗透到文化和生活方式内容中，尤其是PRC对齐的模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly shape public understanding and
civic decisions, yet their ideological neutrality is a growing concern. While
existing research has explored various forms of LLM bias, a direct,
cross-lingual comparison of models with differing geopolitical
alignments-specifically a PRC-system model versus a non-PRC counterpart-has
been lacking. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating
DeepSeek-R1 (PRC-aligned) against ChatGPT o3-mini-high (non-PRC) for
Chinese-state propaganda and anti-U.S. sentiment. We developed a novel corpus
of 1,200 de-contextualized, reasoning-oriented questions derived from
Chinese-language news, presented in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese,
and English. Answers from both models (7,200 total) were assessed using a
hybrid evaluation pipeline combining rubric-guided GPT-4o scoring with human
annotation. Our findings reveal significant model-level and language-dependent
biases. DeepSeek-R1 consistently exhibited substantially higher proportions of
both propaganda and anti-U.S. bias compared to ChatGPT o3-mini-high, which
remained largely free of anti-U.S. sentiment and showed lower propaganda
levels. For DeepSeek-R1, Simplified Chinese queries elicited the highest bias
rates; these diminished in Traditional Chinese and were nearly absent in
English. Notably, DeepSeek-R1 occasionally responded in Simplified Chinese to
Traditional Chinese queries and amplified existing PRC-aligned terms in its
Chinese answers, demonstrating an "invisible loudspeaker" effect. Furthermore,
such biases were not confined to overtly political topics but also permeated
cultural and lifestyle content, particularly in DeepSeek-R1.

Motivation: 评估AI辅导员在识别和定位学生错误方面的能力，以提升教育对话场景中的辅导效果。

Method: 基于MPNet模型，使用类加权交叉熵损失处理类别不平衡，采用分组交叉验证（10折）和硬投票集成方法优化模型性能。

Result: 在官方测试集上，错误识别和错误定位的宏F1分数分别为0.7110和0.5543。

Conclusion: 提出的集成方法为教育对话中辅导员响应评估系统的设计提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: We present Team BD's submission to the BEA 2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical
Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors, under Track 1 (Mistake Identification)
and Track 2 (Mistake Location). Both tracks involve three-class classification
of tutor responses in educational dialogues - determining if a tutor correctly
recognizes a student's mistake (Track 1) and whether the tutor pinpoints the
mistake's location (Track 2). Our system is built on MPNet, a Transformer-based
language model that combines BERT and XLNet's pre-training advantages. We
fine-tuned MPNet on the task data using a class-weighted cross-entropy loss to
handle class imbalance, and leveraged grouped cross-validation (10 folds) to
maximize the use of limited data while avoiding dialogue overlap between
training and validation. We then performed a hard-voting ensemble of the best
models from each fold, which improves robustness and generalization by
combining multiple classifiers. Our approach achieved strong results on both
tracks, with exact-match macro-F1 scores of approximately 0.7110 for Mistake
Identification and 0.5543 for Mistake Location on the official test set. We
include comprehensive analysis of our system's performance, including confusion
matrices and t-SNE visualizations to interpret classifier behavior, as well as
a taxonomy of common errors with examples. We hope our ensemble-based approach
and findings provide useful insights for designing reliable tutor response
evaluation systems in educational dialogue settings.

Motivation: 随着AI和LLMs的发展，自动化任务受到关注，但专业工业幽默的评估尚未被充分研究。

Method: 开发了一个专业幽默数据集，并评估了五种LLMs对幽默适当性的判断能力。

Result: LLMs在准确判断幽默适当性方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 需要进一步改进LLMs以更好地理解和评估专业幽默。

Abstract: With the recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language

in workplaces, has been largely neglected. To address this, we develop a
dataset of professional humor statements along with features that determine the
appropriateness of each statement. Our evaluation of five LLMs shows that LLMs
often struggle to judge the appropriateness of humor accurately.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前引用评估依赖NLI方法，效果有限，需更全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出CiteEval框架，构建CiteBench基准，开发CiteEval-Auto自动评估工具。

Result: CiteEval-Auto在多领域实验中表现优于现有指标。

Conclusion: CiteEval提供了一种可扩展的引用评估方法，提升模型生成引用的质量。

Abstract: Citation quality is crucial in information-seeking systems, directly
influencing trust and the effectiveness of information access. Current
evaluation frameworks, both human and automatic, mainly rely on Natural
Language Inference (NLI) to assess binary or ternary supportiveness from cited
sources, which we argue is a suboptimal proxy for citation evaluation. In this
work we introduce CiteEval, a citation evaluation framework driven by
principles focusing on fine-grained citation assessment within a broad context,
encompassing not only the cited sources but the full retrieval context, user
query, and generated text. Guided by the proposed framework, we construct
CiteBench, a multi-domain benchmark with high-quality human annotations on
citation quality. To enable efficient evaluation, we further develop
CiteEval-Auto, a suite of model-based metrics that exhibit strong correlation
with human judgments. Experiments across diverse systems demonstrate
CiteEval-Auto's superior ability to capture the multifaceted nature of
citations compared to existing metrics, offering a principled and scalable
approach to evaluate and improve model-generated citations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最小对干预的方法，评估大型语言模型（LLMs）是否像双语者一样使用代码转换（CS），并发现模型规模越大，越倾向于自然出现的CS句子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在语言覆盖范围、CS现象多样性或可扩展性方面不足，缺乏评估LLMs使用CS的方法。

Method: 通过收集11种语言对的CS最小对（自然CS句子与人工变体），进行人类和LLMs实验。

Result: 双语者一致偏好自然CS句子；LLMs规模越大，越倾向于自然CS句子，尤其是封闭类词的变体差异最大。

Conclusion: LLMs在CS行为上与双语者表现一致，模型规模是关键因素。

Abstract: There is a lack of an evaluation methodology that estimates the extent to
which large language models (LLMs) use code-switching (CS) in the same way as
bilinguals. Existing methods do not have wide language coverage, fail to
account for the diverse range of CS phenomena, or do not scale. We propose an
intervention based on minimal pairs of CS. Each minimal pair contains one
naturally occurring CS sentence and one minimally manipulated variant. We
collect up to 1,000 such pairs each for 11 language pairs. Our human
experiments show that, for every language pair, bilinguals consistently prefer
the naturally occurring CS sentence. Meanwhile our experiments with current
LLMs show that the larger the model, the more consistently it assigns higher
probability to the naturally occurring CS sentence than to the variant. In
accordance with theoretical claims, the largest probability differences arise
in those pairs where the manipulated material consisted of closed-class words.

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏大规模、多语言的实验验证语法对语码转换的影响，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计实验，确保预测系统仅依赖语法信息，测试其对语码转换的预测能力。

Result: 实验表明，仅语法信息足以让系统像双语者一样区分语码转换句子，且学到的语法模式能泛化到未见过的语言对。

Conclusion: 语法是解释语码转换模式的关键因素，且其预测能力具有普适性。

Abstract: The theoretical code-switching (CS) literature provides numerous pointwise
investigations that aim to explain patterns in CS, i.e. why bilinguals switch
language in certain positions in a sentence more often than in others. A
resulting consensus is that CS can be explained by the syntax of the
contributing languages. There is however no large-scale, multi-language,
cross-phenomena experiment that tests this claim. When designing such an
experiment, we need to make sure that the system that is predicting where
bilinguals tend to switch has access only to syntactic information. We provide
such an experiment here. Results show that syntax alone is sufficient for an
automatic system to distinguish between sentences in minimal pairs of CS, to
the same degree as bilingual humans. Furthermore, the learnt syntactic patterns
generalise well to unseen language pairs.

Method: 通过109个人工模拟对话（313个用户轮次）进行离策略轮级评估，结合对话行为标注分析模型响应。

Result: 部分模型能处理长对话和20+API，但多数模型在长上下文或API增加时表现不佳，链式功能调用性能普遍受限。表现最佳的是Nova Pro（40.01%）、Claude Sonnet v3.5（35.46%）和Llama 3.1 405B（33.19%）。

Conclusion: CONFETTI揭示了LLM在复杂对话和功能调用中的局限性，为未来模型优化提供了方向。

Abstract: We introduce Conversational Function-Calling Evaluation Through Turn-Level
Interactions (CONFETTI), a conversational benchmark1 designed to evaluate the
function-calling capabilities and response quality of large language models
(LLMs). Current benchmarks lack comprehensive assessment of LLMs in complex
conversational scenarios. CONFETTI addresses this gap through 109
human-simulated conversations, comprising 313 user turns and covering 86 APIs.
These conversations explicitly target various conversational complexities, such
as follow-ups, goal correction and switching, ambiguous and implicit goals. We
perform off-policy turn-level evaluation using this benchmark targeting
function-calling. Our benchmark also incorporates dialog act annotations to
assess agent responses. We evaluate a series of state-of-the-art LLMs and
analyze their performance with respect to the number of available APIs,
conversation lengths, and chained function calling. Our results reveal that
while some models are able to handle long conversations, and leverage more than
20+ APIs successfully, other models struggle with longer context or when
increasing the number of APIs. We also report that the performance on chained
function-calls is severely limited across the models. Overall, the top
performing models on CONFETTI are Nova Pro (40.01%), Claude Sonnet v3.5
(35.46%) and Llama 3.1 405B (33.19%) followed by command-r-plus (31.18%) and

Result: 通过大量实验，评估了模态扩展的权衡，并提供了实现真正全模态的可行性见解。

Conclusion: 当前方法在实现全模态方面存在挑战，但模态扩展和模型合并可能为未来研究提供方向。

Abstract: Omni-modal language models (OLMs) aim to integrate and reason over diverse
input modalities--such as text, images, video, and audio--while maintaining
strong language capabilities. Despite recent advancements, existing models,
especially open-source ones, remain far from true omni-modality, struggling to
generalize beyond the specific modality pairs they are trained on or to achieve
strong performance when processing multi-modal inputs. We study the effect of
extending modality, the dominant technique for training multimodal models,
where an off-the-shelf language model is fine-tuned on target-domain and
language data. Specifically, we investigate three key questions: (1) Does
modality extension compromise core language abilities? (2) Can model merging
effectively integrate independently fine-tuned modality-specific models to
achieve omni-modality? (3) Does omni-modality extension lead to better
knowledge sharing and generalization compared to sequential extension? Through
extensive experiments, we analyze these trade-offs and provide insights into
the feasibility of achieving true omni-modality using current approaches.

Motivation: 现有单细胞LLMs难以整合空间信息和捕捉细胞间交互，限制了其生物学关系建模能力。

Method: 提出Spatial2Sentence框架，通过构建表达相似性和距离矩阵，将空间相邻和表达相似的细胞配对为正样本，远距离和不相似的为负样本，利用多句子表示让LLMs学习细胞在表达和空间上的交互。

Result: 在预处理IMC数据集上，Spatial2Sentence在细胞类型分类和临床状态预测上分别提升5.98%和4.18%。

Conclusion: Spatial2Sentence通过多句子表示和多任务学习，显著提升了单细胞LLMs的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Image mass cytometry (IMC) enables high-dimensional spatial profiling by
combining mass cytometry's analytical power with spatial distributions of cell
phenotypes. Recent studies leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract
cell states by translating gene or protein expression into biological context.
However, existing single-cell LLMs face two major challenges: (1) Integration
of spatial information: they struggle to generalize spatial coordinates and
effectively encode spatial context as text, and (2) Treating each cell
independently: they overlook cell-cell interactions, limiting their ability to
capture biological relationships. To address these limitations, we propose
Spatial2Sentence, a novel framework that integrates single-cell expression and
spatial information into natural language using a multi-sentence approach.
Spatial2Sentence constructs expression similarity and distance matrices,
pairing spatially adjacent and expressionally similar cells as positive pairs
while using distant and dissimilar cells as negatives. These multi-sentence
representations enable LLMs to learn cellular interactions in both expression
and spatial contexts. Equipped with multi-task learning, Spatial2Sentence
outperforms existing single-cell LLMs on preprocessed IMC datasets, improving
cell-type classification by 5.98% and clinical status prediction by 4.18% on
the diabetes dataset while enhancing interpretability. The source code can be

Result: 模型表现差异显著，Claude 3.5 Sonnet总体准确率最高（30%），在数学理论、阿拉伯语和伊斯兰领域表现突出。

Conclusion: 强调文化能力与技术能力并重，为阿拉伯语模型评估提供理论和实践指导。

Abstract: This paper addresses critical gaps in Arabic language model evaluation by
establishing comprehensive theoretical guidelines and introducing a novel
evaluation framework. We first analyze existing Arabic evaluation datasets,
identifying significant issues in linguistic accuracy, cultural alignment, and
methodological rigor. To address these limitations in LLMs, we present the
Arabic Depth Mini Dataset (ADMD), a carefully curated collection of 490
challenging questions spanning ten major domains (42 sub-domains, see Figure 1.
Using ADMD, we evaluate five leading language models: GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet,
Gemini Flash 1.5, CommandR 100B, and Qwen-Max. Our results reveal significant
variations in model performance across different domains, with particular
challenges in areas requiring deep cultural understanding and specialized
knowledge. Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrated the highest overall accuracy at 30\%,
showing relative strength in mathematical theory in Arabic, Arabic language,
and islamic domains. This work provides both theoretical foundations and
practical insights for improving Arabic language model evaluation, emphasizing
the importance of cultural competence alongside technical capabilities.

Conclusion: Eso-LMs成功克服了自回归和掩码扩散模型的局限性，显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models offer a compelling alternative to
autoregressive (AR) models by enabling parallel and controllable generation.
Among this family of models, Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) achieve the
strongest performance but still underperform AR models in perplexity and lack
key inference-time efficiency features--most notably, KV caching. In this work,
we introduce Eso-LMs, a new family of models that fuses AR and MDM paradigms,
enabling smooth interpolation between their perplexities while overcoming their
respective limitations. Eso-LMs set a new state of the art on standard language
modeling benchmarks. Crucially, we are the **first to introduce KV caching for
MDMs** while preserving parallel generation, significantly improving inference
efficiency. Combined with an optimized sampling schedule, our method achieves
up to **65x** faster inference than standard MDMs and **4x** faster inference
than prior semi-autoregressive approaches. We provide the code and model
checkpoints on the project page:

Motivation: 当前奖励模型在评估方面的进展未能有效提升下游任务性能，需要更严格的评估方法。

Method: 通过构建RewardBench 2基准，使用新的人类提示而非现有下游评估提示，进行更严格的奖励模型评估。

Result: RewardBench 2使模型平均得分比RewardBench低20分，但与下游性能高度相关。

Conclusion: RewardBench 2为奖励模型提供了更有效的评估工具，有助于提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: Reward models are used throughout the post-training of language models to
capture nuanced signals from preference data and provide a training target for
optimization across instruction following, reasoning, safety, and more domains.
The community has begun establishing best practices for evaluating reward
models, from the development of benchmarks that test capabilities in specific
skill areas to others that test agreement with human preferences. At the same
time, progress in evaluation has not been mirrored by the effectiveness of
reward models in downstream tasks -- simpler direct alignment algorithms are
reported to work better in many cases. This paper introduces RewardBench 2, a
new multi-skill reward modeling benchmark designed to bring new, challenging
data for accuracy-based reward model evaluation -- models score about 20 points
on average lower on RewardBench 2 compared to the first RewardBench -- while
being highly correlated with downstream performance. Compared to most other
benchmarks, RewardBench 2 sources new human prompts instead of existing prompts
from downstream evaluations, facilitating more rigorous evaluation practices.
In this paper, we describe our benchmark construction process and report how
existing models perform on it, while quantifying how performance on the
benchmark correlates with downstream use of the models in both inference-time
scaling algorithms, like best-of-N sampling, and RLHF training algorithms like
proximal policy optimization.

Motivation: 探索RLVR机制，理解token熵模式如何影响大语言模型的推理能力。

Method: 通过分析Chain-of-Thought推理中的token熵模式，研究RLVR训练中熵模式的演变，并优化高熵token。

Result: 仅优化20%高熵token即可保持性能，且在更大模型上表现更优（如Qwen3-32B提升11.04分）。

Conclusion: RLVR效果主要来自优化高熵token，未来可通过熵视角进一步优化LLM推理。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), while its mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work,
we undertake a pioneering exploration of RLVR through the novel perspective of
token entropy patterns, comprehensively analyzing how different tokens
influence reasoning performance. By examining token entropy patterns in
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, we observe that only a small fraction of
tokens exhibit high entropy, and these tokens act as critical forks that steer
the model toward diverse reasoning pathways. Furthermore, studying how entropy
patterns evolve during RLVR training reveals that RLVR largely adheres to the
base model's entropy patterns, primarily adjusting the entropy of high-entropy
tokens. These findings highlight the significance of high-entropy tokens (i.e.,
forking tokens) to RLVR. We ultimately improve RLVR by restricting policy
gradient updates to forking tokens and uncover a finding even beyond the 80/20
rule: utilizing only 20% of the tokens while maintaining performance comparable
to full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-8B base model and significantly
surpassing full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-32B (+11.04 on AIME'25 and +7.71
on AIME'24) and Qwen3-14B (+4.79 on AIME'25 and +5.21 on AIME'24) base models,
highlighting a strong scaling trend. In contrast, training exclusively on the
80% lowest-entropy tokens leads to a marked decline in performance. These
findings indicate that the efficacy of RLVR primarily arises from optimizing
the high-entropy tokens that decide reasoning directions. Collectively, our
results highlight the potential to understand RLVR through a token-entropy
perspective and optimize RLVR by leveraging high-entropy minority tokens to
further improve LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在多选问答中随着选项增加，表现出置信度失真问题（正确预测信心不足，错误预测过度自信），导致性能下降。

Method: 将选项分组，通过设计的注意力掩码和位置编码集成LLM预测，无需标注数据调参。

Result: 在三个LLM和数据集上，Self-ensemble显著优于标准推理和基线方法。

Conclusion: Self-ensemble有效解决了LLM的置信度失真问题，具有即插即用的优势。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general fields, they
exhibit a confidence distortion problem on multi-choice question-answering
(MCQA), particularly as the number of answer choices increases. Specifically,
on MCQA with many choices, LLMs suffer from under-confidence in correct
predictions and over-confidence in incorrect ones, leading to a substantially
degraded performance. To solve this problem, we propose Self-ensemble in this
work. Our method splits the choices into several groups and ensembles LLM
predictions across these groups to reach a final decision. The advantage of
Self-ensemble is its plug-and-play nature, where it can be integrated into
existing LLM architecture based on a designed attention mask and positional
encoding, without requiring labeled datasets for parameter tuning. Experimental
results on three LLMs and datasets demonstrate that Self-ensemble
comprehensively addresses the confidence distortion problem of LLMs,
outperforming standard inference as well as baseline methods.

Motivation: 研究LLM是否能超越一般浏览任务，处理人类常避免的复杂繁琐任务。

Method: 基于WebArena的四个模拟环境，设计WebChoreArena，集成三类挑战任务。

Result: 实验显示，随着LLM（如GPT-4o、Claude 3.7 Sonnet、Gemini 2.5 Pro）的进步，性能显著提升，但仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: WebChoreArena能清晰衡量LLM的进展，但现有模型在处理复杂任务时仍有不足。

Abstract: Powered by a large language model (LLM), a web browsing agent operates web
browsers in a human-like manner and offers a highly transparent path toward
automating a wide range of everyday tasks. As web agents become increasingly
capable and demonstrate proficiency in general browsing tasks, a critical
question emerges: Can they go beyond general browsing to robustly handle tasks
that are tedious and complex, or chores that humans often avoid doing
themselves? In this paper, we introduce WebChoreArena, a new fully reproducible
benchmark comprising 532 carefully curated tasks designed to extend the scope
of WebArena beyond general browsing to more labor-intensive and tedious tasks.
WebChoreArena systematically integrates three key challenges: (i) Massive
Memory tasks requiring accurate retrieval of large amounts of information in
the observations, (ii) Calculation tasks demanding precise mathematical
reasoning, and (iii) Long-Term Memory tasks necessitating long-term memory
across multiple webpages. Built on top of the fully reproducible and widely
adopted four WebArena simulation environments, WebChoreArena ensures strict
reproducibility and enables fair, direct comparisons with the established
WebArena benchmark, offering key insights into agent progress. Our experimental
results demonstrate that as LLMs evolve, represented by GPT-4o, Claude 3.7
Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, significant improvements in performance are
observed on WebChoreArena. These findings suggest that WebChoreArena is
well-suited to measure the advancement of state-of-the-art LLMs with greater
clarity. Nevertheless, the results also indicate that even with Gemini 2.5 Pro,
there remains substantial room for improvement compared to WebArena,
highlighting the increased challenges posed by WebChoreArena.

Motivation: 大规模RAG系统计算资源消耗高且容易产生幻觉内容，需要一种高效且资源节约的方法来提升小型模型的性能。

Conclusion: DRAG为小型语言模型提供了一种高效、资源节约的检索增强生成解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have proven highly effective for
tasks requiring factual consistency and robust knowledge retrieval. However,
large-scale RAG systems consume significant computational resources and are
prone to generating hallucinated content from Humans. In this work, we
introduce $\texttt{DRAG}$, a novel framework for distilling RAG knowledge from
large-scale Language Models (LLMs) into small LMs (SLMs). Our approach
leverages evidence- and knowledge graph-based distillation, ensuring that the
distilled model retains critical factual knowledge while significantly reducing
model size and computational cost. By aligning the smaller model's predictions
with a structured knowledge graph and ranked evidence, $\texttt{DRAG}$
effectively mitigates hallucinations and improves factual accuracy. We further
present a case demonstrating how our framework mitigates user privacy risks and
introduce a corresponding benchmark. Experimental evaluations on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the prior competitive RAG
methods like MiniRAG for SLMs by up to 27.7% using the same models, preserving
high-level efficiency and reliability. With $\texttt{DRAG}$, we provide a
practical and resource-efficient roadmap to deploying enhanced retrieval and
generation capabilities in small-sized LLMs.

Conclusion: 逆向设计应发展为结合领域知识、物理先验和自适应推理的统一生态系统，以实现高效、可解释的AI驱动设计。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping inverse design across manufacturing
domain, enabling high-performance discovery in materials, products, and
processes. However, purely data-driven approaches often struggle in realistic
settings characterized by sparse data, high-dimensional design spaces, and
nontrivial physical constraints. This perspective argues for a new generation
of design systems that transcend black-box modeling by integrating domain
knowledge, physics-informed learning, and intuitive human-AI interfaces. We
first demonstrate how expert-guided sampling strategies enhance data efficiency
and model generalization. Next, we discuss how physics-informed machine
learning enables physically consistent modeling in data-scarce regimes.
Finally, we explore how large language models emerge as interactive design
agents connecting user intent with simulation tools, optimization pipelines,
and collaborative workflows. Through illustrative examples and conceptual
frameworks, we advocate that inverse design in manufacturing should evolve into
a unified ecosystem, where domain knowledge, physical priors, and adaptive
reasoning collectively enable scalable, interpretable, and accessible AI-driven
design systems.

Result: AI代理的表现差异显著，行为异常可能导致财务损失（如过度消费或不合理交易）。

Conclusion: 自动化虽提升效率，但伴随重大风险，用户需谨慎授权AI代理处理商业决策。

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used in consumer-facing applications to assist
with tasks such as product search, negotiation, and transaction execution. In
this paper, we explore a future scenario where both consumers and merchants
authorize AI agents to fully automate negotiations and transactions. We aim to
answer two key questions: (1) Do different LLM agents vary in their ability to
secure favorable deals for users? (2) What risks arise from fully automating
deal-making with AI agents in consumer markets? To address these questions, we
develop an experimental framework that evaluates the performance of various LLM
agents in real-world negotiation and transaction settings. Our findings reveal
that AI-mediated deal-making is an inherently imbalanced game -- different
agents achieve significantly different outcomes for their users. Moreover,
behavioral anomalies in LLMs can result in financial losses for both consumers
and merchants, such as overspending or accepting unreasonable deals. These
results underscore that while automation can improve efficiency, it also
introduces substantial risks. Users should exercise caution when delegating
business decisions to AI agents.

Conclusion: AI辅助的监管方法可将竞争性社会困境转化为双赢均衡，为公平市场监督提供实用框架。

Abstract: Dynamic, risk-based pricing can systematically exclude vulnerable consumer
groups from essential resources such as health insurance and consumer credit.
We show that a regulator can realign private incentives with social objectives
through a learned, interpretable tax schedule. First, we provide a formal
proposition that bounding each firm's \emph{local} demographic gap implicitly
bounds the \emph{global} opt-out disparity, motivating firm-level penalties.
Building on this insight we introduce \texttt{MarketSim} -- an open-source,
scalable simulator of heterogeneous consumers and profit-maximizing firms --
and train a reinforcement learning (RL) social planner (SP) that selects a
bracketed fairness-tax while remaining close to a simple linear prior via an
$\mathcal{L}_1$ regularizer. The learned policy is thus both transparent and
easily interpretable. In two empirically calibrated markets, i.e., U.S.
health-insurance and consumer-credit, our planner simultaneously raises
demand-fairness by up to $16\%$ relative to unregulated Free Market while
outperforming a fixed linear schedule in terms of social welfare without
explicit coordination. These results illustrate how AI-assisted regulation can
convert a competitive social dilemma into a win-win equilibrium, providing a
principled and practical framework for fairness-aware market oversight.

Abstract: The volume of textual data available in aviation safety reports presents a
challenge for timely and accurate analysis. This paper examines how Artificial

automate the process of extracting valuable insights from this data, ultimately
enhancing aviation safety. The paper reviews ongoing efforts focused on the
application of NLP and deep learning to aviation safety reports, with the goal
of classifying the level of damage to an aircraft and identifying the phase of
flight during which safety occurrences happen. Additionally, the paper explores
the use of Topic Modeling (TM) to uncover latent thematic structures within
aviation incident reports, aiming to identify recurring patterns and potential
areas for safety improvement. The paper compares and contrasts the performance
of various deep learning models and TM techniques applied to datasets from the
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Australian Transport Safety
Bureau (ATSB), as well as the Aviation Safety Network (ASN), discussing the
impact of dataset size and source on the accuracy of the analysis. The findings
demonstrate that both NLP and deep learning, as well as TM, can significantly
improve the efficiency and accuracy of aviation safety analysis, paving the way
for more proactive safety management and risk mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: DEEVO通过结合LLM推理与自适应优化，推动了提示优化研究的进步。

Abstract: Prompt engineering represents a critical bottleneck to harness the full
potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for solving complex tasks, as it
requires specialized expertise, significant trial-and-error, and manual
intervention. This challenge is particularly pronounced for tasks involving
subjective quality assessment, where defining explicit optimization objectives
becomes fundamentally problematic. Existing automated prompt optimization
methods falter in these scenarios, as they typically require well-defined
task-specific numerical fitness functions or rely on generic templates that
cannot capture the nuanced requirements of complex use cases. We introduce
DEEVO (DEbate-driven EVOlutionary prompt optimization), a novel framework that
guides prompt evolution through a debate-driven evaluation with an Elo-based
selection. Contrary to prior work, DEEVOs approach enables exploration of the
discrete prompt space while preserving semantic coherence through intelligent
crossover and strategic mutation operations that incorporate debate-based
feedback, combining elements from both successful and unsuccessful prompts
based on identified strengths rather than arbitrary splicing. Using Elo ratings
as a fitness proxy, DEEVO simultaneously drives improvement and preserves
valuable diversity in the prompt population. Experimental results demonstrate
that DEEVO significantly outperforms both manual prompt engineering and
alternative state-of-the-art optimization approaches on open-ended tasks and
close-ended tasks despite using no ground truth feedback. By connecting LLMs
reasoning capabilities with adaptive optimization, DEEVO represents a
significant advancement in prompt optimization research by eliminating the need
of predetermined metrics to continuously improve AI systems.

enhance reasoning control, we propose a Conditional Distillation Finetuning

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI的快速发展引发了数据隐私、偏见和决策透明度等伦理问题，亟需一种透明且可审计的伦理评估方法。

Method: 通过构建基于本体块的模块化框架，结合FAIR原则，支持动态风险评估和伦理合规。

Result: 框架在AI投资者分析中验证了其有效性，表明本体块为可解释的AI伦理提供了可行路径。

Conclusion: 本体块为AI伦理提供了透明和可审计的解决方案，但在自动化和概率推理方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming sectors such as healthcare,
finance, and autonomous systems, offering powerful tools for innovation. Yet
its rapid integration raises urgent ethical concerns related to data ownership,
privacy, and systemic bias. Issues like opaque decision-making, misleading
outputs, and unfair treatment in high-stakes domains underscore the need for
transparent and accountable AI systems. This article addresses these challenges
by proposing a modular ethical assessment framework built on ontological blocks
of meaning-discrete, interpretable units that encode ethical principles such as
fairness, accountability, and ownership. By integrating these blocks with FAIR
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, the framework
supports scalable, transparent, and legally aligned ethical evaluations,
including compliance with the EU AI Act. Using a real-world use case in
AI-powered investor profiling, the paper demonstrates how the framework enables
dynamic, behavior-informed risk classification. The findings suggest that
ontological blocks offer a promising path toward explainable and auditable AI
ethics, though challenges remain in automation and probabilistic reasoning.

*Dewei Feng,Carol Li,Wei Dai,Paul Pu Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SmellNet是首个大规模气味数据库，用于训练和评估AI嗅觉能力，包含18万时间步的50种物质数据。最佳模型在预录数据上达到65.35%准确率，但在实时分类任务中表现较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI嗅觉研究缺乏大规模基准，限制了实际应用。SmellNet旨在填补这一空白，推动AI在过敏原检测、制造监控等领域的应用。

Method: 使用便携式气体和化学传感器构建SmellNet数据库，结合序列模型、对比学习和新时间差方法训练AI模型。

Result: 模型在预录数据上准确率65.35%，实时分类任务中坚果和香料的准确率分别为10.71%和25.38%。

Conclusion: SmellNet展示了AI嗅觉的潜力，但也揭示了特征学习、边缘计算和环境鲁棒性等技术挑战。

Abstract: The ability of AI to sense and identify various substances based on their
smell alone can have profound impacts on allergen detection (e.g., smelling
gluten or peanuts in a cake), monitoring the manufacturing process, and sensing
hormones that indicate emotional states, stress levels, and diseases. Despite
these broad impacts, there are virtually no large scale benchmarks, and
therefore little progress, for training and evaluating AI systems' ability to
smell in the real world. In this paper, we use portable gas and chemical
sensors to create SmellNet, the first large-scale database that digitizes a
diverse range of smells in the natural world. SmellNet contains about 180,000
time steps of 50 substances (spanning nuts, spices, herbs, fruits, and
vegetables) with 50 hours of data. Using SmellNet, we train AI models for
real-time classification of substances based on their smell alone. Our best
methods leverage sequence models, contrastive learning to integrate
high-resolution Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry molecular data, and a new
temporal difference method that identifies sharp changes in sensor readings.
Our best models achieve up to 65.35% accuracy on pre-recorded data, and
generalize to real-world conditions with 10.71% accuracy on nuts and 25.38% on
spices in the challenging 50-way online classification task. Despite these
promising results, SmellNet highlights many technical challenges in building AI
for smell, including richer feature learning, on-edge smell models, and
robustness to environmental changes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于软提示微调的新框架，用于高效实现大型语言模型的文化对齐，显著提升了文化敏感性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在多样文化背景下缺乏细腻理解，且全微调成本高昂，亟需一种高效且模块化的文化对齐方法。

Method: 采用向量化提示调优技术，动态将查询路由到由文化专家配置的LLM委员会，通过优化软提示嵌入而不改变基础模型参数。

Result: 实验表明，文化对齐分数从0.208提升至0.820，显著增强了文化敏感性和适应性。

Conclusion: 该框架为文化感知的LLM部署提供了稳健解决方案，并为后续研究文化覆盖和动态专家适应奠定了基础。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into global applications
necessitates effective cultural alignment for meaningful and
culturally-sensitive interactions. Current LLMs often lack the nuanced
understanding required for diverse cultural contexts, and adapting them
typically involves costly full fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce a
novel soft prompt fine-tuning framework that enables efficient and modular
cultural alignment. Our method utilizes vectorized prompt tuning to dynamically
route queries to a committee of culturally specialized 'expert' LLM
configurations, created by optimizing soft prompt embeddings without altering
the base model's parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework significantly enhances cultural sensitivity and adaptability,
improving alignment scores from 0.208 to 0.820, offering a robust solution for
culturally-aware LLM deployment. This research paves the way for subsequent
investigations into enhanced cultural coverage and dynamic expert adaptation,
crucial for realizing autonomous AI with deeply nuanced understanding in a
globally interconnected world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖文献检索的质量和性质，效果差异大，需解决如何检索能激发研究问题解决方案的先前工作。

Method: 构建MAG图捕捉方法学谱系，改进密集检索器以识别方法灵感模式，并采用LLM重排序策略。

Result: 在Recall@3和mAP上分别提升+5.4和+7.8，LLM重排序进一步提升了+4.5和+4.8。

Conclusion: MIR有望增强自动化科学发现，并为进一步研究提供了方向。

Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in harnessing the reasoning capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate scientific discovery. While
existing approaches rely on grounding the discovery process within the relevant
literature, effectiveness varies significantly with the quality and nature of
the retrieved literature. We address the challenge of retrieving prior work
whose concepts can inspire solutions for a given research problem, a task we
define as Methodology Inspiration Retrieval (MIR). We construct a novel dataset
tailored for training and evaluating retrievers on MIR, and establish
baselines. To address MIR, we build the Methodology Adjacency Graph (MAG);
capturing methodological lineage through citation relationships. We leverage
MAG to embed an "intuitive prior" into dense retrievers for identifying
patterns of methodological inspiration beyond superficial semantic similarity.
This achieves significant gains of +5.4 in Recall@3 and +7.8 in Mean Average
Precision (mAP) over strong baselines. Further, we adapt LLM-based re-ranking
strategies to MIR, yielding additional improvements of +4.5 in Recall@3 and
+4.8 in mAP. Through extensive ablation studies and qualitative analyses, we
exhibit the promise of MIR in enhancing automated scientific discovery and
outline avenues for advancing inspiration-driven retrieval.

Motivation: 研究MLLMs在现实环境中处理隐含推理问题的能力，揭示其行为与能力之间的差距。

Method: 使用包含四类现实故障模式的诊断套件评估六种MLLMs，包括o3和GPT-4o，并通过显式提示和推理时干预测试模型表现。

Result: 模型常未能发现隐藏问题，但具备相关能力；通过谨慎角色提示和澄清问题等干预可显著改善性能。

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs在推理能力与行为合规性间存在差距，需通过干预策略提升其在开放环境中的可信度。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in
open-ended, real-world environments where inputs are messy, underspecified, and
not always trustworthy. Unlike curated benchmarks, these settings frequently
involve instructions that refer to missing objects or contradictory facts, rely
on ambiguous references, or request infeasible actions. In such cases, success
hinges not on task execution alone, but on a model's ability to detect when
something is silently wrong. This paper presents a systematic analysis of how
current MLLMs handle such implicit reasoning scenarios: cases where the flaw is
not explicitly stated but must be inferred from context. Using a curated
diagnostic suite spanning four categories of real-world failure modes, we
evaluate six MLLMs, including o3 and GPT-4o, and find that models frequently
fail to surface hidden issues, even when they possess the necessary perceptual
and reasoning skills. Explicit prompting reveals that the underlying
capabilities exist but are often suppressed in favor of user compliance. We
further show that simple inference-time interventions, such as cautious persona
prompting and, in particular, requiring a clarifying question, can dramatically
recover performance. Our findings highlight a persistent gap between reasoning
competence and behavioral compliance in current MLLMs and suggest practical
strategies for making these models more trustworthy in underconstrained
environments.

Conclusion: 研究证明了多尺度特征提取和多模态学习方法在利用睡眠信号预测认知表现方面的有效性，代码已公开。

Abstract: Despite extensive research on the relationship between sleep and cognition,
the connection between sleep microstructure and human performance across
specific cognitive domains remains underexplored. This study investigates
whether deep learning models can predict executive functions, particularly
cognitive adaptability and conceptual reasoning from physiological processes
during a night's sleep. To address this, we introduce CogPSGFormer, a
multi-scale convolutional-transformer model designed to process multi-modal
polysomnographic data. This model integrates one-channel ECG and EEG signals
along with extracted features, including EEG power bands and heart rate
variability parameters, to capture complementary information across modalities.
A thorough evaluation of the CogPSGFormer architecture was conducted to
optimize the processing of extended sleep signals and identify the most
effective configuration. The proposed framework was evaluated on 817
individuals from the STAGES dataset using cross-validation. The model achieved
80.3\% accuracy in classifying individuals into low vs. high cognitive
performance groups on unseen data based on Penn Conditional Exclusion Test
(PCET) scores. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our multi-scale
feature extraction and multi-modal learning approach in leveraging
sleep-derived signals for cognitive performance prediction. To facilitate
reproducibility, our code is publicly accessible

Motivation: 探索大语言模型在解决数学问题上的潜力，填补研究空白。

Method: 采用基于SCoT框架的五维评估方法，比较三种模型在三个不同复杂度数学数据集上的表现。

Result: GPT-4o表现最稳定，DeepSeek-V3在优化任务中强但统计推理不稳定，Gemini-2.0语言理解好但推理能力差。

Conclusion: 不同模型各有优劣，需针对性改进以提升数学问题解决能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on a range of
educational tasks, but are still understudied for their potential to solve
mathematical problems. In this study, we compare three prominent LLMs,
including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini-2.0, on three mathematics datasets of
varying complexities (GSM8K, MATH500, and UNSW datasets). We take a
five-dimensional approach based on the Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT)
framework to assess final answer correctness, step completeness, step validity,
intermediate calculation accuracy, and problem comprehension. The results show
that GPT-4o is the most stable and consistent in performance across all the
datasets, but particularly it performs outstandingly in high-level questions of
the UNSW dataset. DeepSeek-V3 is competitively strong in well-structured
domains such as optimisation, but suffers from fluctuations in accuracy in
statistical inference tasks. Gemini-2.0 shows strong linguistic understanding
and clarity in well-structured problems but performs poorly in multi-step
reasoning and symbolic logic. Our error analysis reveals particular deficits in
each model: GPT-4o is at times lacking in sufficient explanation or precision;
DeepSeek-V3 leaves out intermediate steps; and Gemini-2.0 is less flexible in
mathematical reasoning in higher dimensions.

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在复杂任务中表现优异，但缺乏对长视野任务有效行为的明确理解，需改进AI代理的推理、规划和行动能力。

Method: 提出Dyna-Think框架，结合规划与内部世界模型；DIT通过模仿学习重构R1的思维过程，DDT通过两阶段训练提升世界建模和行动能力。

Conclusion: 将世界模型模拟集成到AI代理中，可显著增强其推理、规划和行动能力，为未来研究指明方向。

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning with large language models (LLMs), such as
DeepSeek-R1, demonstrates impressive capabilities in domains like mathematics
and coding, by exhibiting complex cognitive behaviors such as verification,
goal decomposition, and self-reflection. However, it is unclear what behavior
is effective and what behavior is missing for long-horizon AI agents tasks. In
this work, we propose Dyna-Think, a thinking framework that integrates planning
with an internal world model with reasoning and acting to enhance AI agent
performance. To enable Dyna-Think, we propose Dyna-Think Imitation Learning
(DIT) and Dyna-Think Dyna Training (DDT). To initialize a policy with
Dyna-Think, DIT reconstructs the thinking process of R1 to focus on performing
world model simulation relevant to the proposed (and planned) action, and
trains the policy using this reconstructed data. To enhance Dyna-Think, DDT
uses a two-stage training process to first improve the agent's world modeling
ability via objectives such as state prediction or critique generation, and
then improve the agent's action via policy training. We evaluate our methods on
OSWorld, and demonstrate that Dyna-Think improves the agent's in-domain and
out-of-domain performance, achieving similar best-of-n performance compared to
R1 while generating 2x less tokens on average. Our extensive empirical studies
reveal that 1) using critique generation for world model training is effective
to improve policy performance; and 2) AI agents with better performance
correlate with better world modeling abilities. We believe our results suggest
a promising research direction to integrate world model simulation into AI
agents to enhance their reasoning, planning, and acting capabilities.

Motivation: 解决深度强化学习策略不透明的问题，以提升验证性、透明度和人类监督能力。

Method: 使用在线进化搜索和质量-多样性优化（QD）生成符号化策略，策略表示为状态变量的有序符号谓词列表。

Result: 在CartPole-v1、MountainCar-v0和Acrobot-v1等基准任务中，BASIL生成的策略与深度强化学习基线性能相当，同时保持可解释性和紧凑性。

Conclusion: BASIL提供了一种结合符号表达、进化多样性和在线学习的统一框架，为可解释策略生成提供了新方法。

Abstract: The quest for interpretable reinforcement learning is a grand challenge for
the deployment of autonomous decision-making systems in safety-critical
applications. Modern deep reinforcement learning approaches, while powerful,
tend to produce opaque policies that compromise verification, reduce
transparency, and impede human oversight. To address this, we introduce BASIL
(Best-Action Symbolic Interpretable Learning), a systematic approach for
generating symbolic, rule-based policies via online evolutionary search with
quality-diversity (QD) optimization. BASIL represents policies as ordered lists
of symbolic predicates over state variables, ensuring full interpretability and
tractable policy complexity. By using a QD archive, the methodology in the
proposed study encourages behavioral and structural diversity between
top-performing solutions, while a complexity-aware fitness encourages the
synthesis of compact representations. The evolutionary system supports the use
of exact constraints for rule count and system adaptability for balancing
transparency with expressiveness. Empirical comparisons with three benchmark
tasks CartPole-v1, MountainCar-v0, and Acrobot-v1 show that BASIL consistently
synthesizes interpretable controllers with compact representations comparable
to deep reinforcement learning baselines. Herein, this article introduces a new
interpretable policy synthesis method that combines symbolic expressiveness,
evolutionary diversity, and online learning through a unifying framework.

Abstract: Despite extraordinary progress in artificial intelligence (AI), modern
systems remain incomplete representations of human cognition. Vision, audition,
and language have received disproportionate attention due to well-defined
benchmarks, standardized datasets, and consensus-driven scientific foundations.
In contrast, olfaction - a high-bandwidth, evolutionarily critical sense - has
been largely overlooked. This omission presents a foundational gap in the
construction of truly embodied and ethically aligned super-human intelligence.
We argue that the exclusion of olfactory perception from AI architectures is
not due to irrelevance but to structural challenges: unresolved scientific
theories of smell, heterogeneous sensor technologies, lack of standardized
olfactory datasets, absence of AI-oriented benchmarks, and difficulty in
evaluating sub-perceptual signal processing. These obstacles have hindered the
development of machine olfaction despite its tight coupling with memory,
emotion, and contextual reasoning in biological systems. In this position
paper, we assert that meaningful progress toward general and embodied
intelligence requires serious investment in olfactory research by the AI
community. We call for cross-disciplinary collaboration - spanning
neuroscience, robotics, machine learning, and ethics - to formalize olfactory
benchmarks, develop multimodal datasets, and define the sensory capabilities
necessary for machines to understand, navigate, and act within human
environments. Recognizing olfaction as a core modality is essential not only
for scientific completeness, but for building AI systems that are ethically
grounded in the full scope of the human experience.

Abstract: World models are emerging as a transformative paradigm in artificial

distinguish world models from related concepts such as digital twins, the
metaverse, and foundation models, clarifying their unique role as embedded
cognitive engines for autonomous agents. We further propose Wireless Dreamer, a
novel world model-based reinforcement learning framework tailored for wireless
edge intelligence optimization, particularly in low-altitude wireless networks

demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in improving learning efficiency

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过内省处理复杂信息，MIRROR旨在将这种能力系统化地引入大语言模型，解决其常见的失败模式（如谄媚、注意力缺陷和约束冲突）。

Method: MIRROR包含Thinker和Talker两层：Thinker协调目标、推理和记忆的并行线程，Talker基于整合的叙事生成上下文感知的响应。

Result: 在CuRaTe基准测试中，MIRROR架构的模型在安全关键场景中性能提升156%，平均准确率>80%，优于基线模型21%。

Conclusion: MIRROR通过模块化内省推理显著提升了大语言模型的多轮对话能力，为认知科学与AI的融合提供了新方向。

Abstract: Human intelligence relies on inner monologue to process complex information
through simultaneous reflection, memory retrieval, and response formulation. We
introduce MIRROR (Modular Internal Reasoning, Reflection, Orchestration, and
Response), a cognitive architecture that systematically implements these
parallel reasoning capabilities in large language models. MIRROR operates as a
unified system with two distinct functional layers: the Thinker and the Talker.
The Thinker encompasses: (1) the Inner Monologue Manager, coordinating
reasoning threads across cognitive dimensions (Goals, Reasoning, and Memory);
and (2) the Cognitive Controller, synthesizing these threads into a coherent
internal narrative maintained across conversation turns. The Talker component
then leverages this integrated narrative for context-aware responses. Evaluated
on the CuRaTe benchmark--testing personalized dialogue with safety-critical
constraints, conflicting preferences, and multi-turn consistency--LLMs
utilizing the MIRROR architecture achieve up to 156% relative improvement in
critical safety scenarios involving three persons with conflicting preferences,
maintaining an average accuracy of ~>80% on all scenarios. Across
scenario-specific comparisons, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Llama
4 variants, and Mistral 3 variants with the MIRROR architecture outperformed
baseline models by 21% on average (15.5 percentage points absolute). MIRROR
directly addresses three critical LLM failure modes: sycophancy, attentional
deficits to critical information, and inconsistent prioritization of
conflicting constraints. This work bridges cognitive science and AI by
implementing modular internal reasoning inspired by human cognition, creating a
persistent internal model that significantly enhances multi-turn conversation
capabilities.

Conclusion: 运行时监控是提升AI模型鲁棒性和可信度的有效补充手段。

Abstract: Input-output robustness appears in various different forms in the literature,
such as robustness of AI models to adversarial or semantic perturbations and
individual fairness of AI models that make decisions about humans.
  We propose runtime monitoring of input-output robustness of deployed,
black-box AI models, where the goal is to design monitors that would observe
one long execution sequence of the model, and would raise an alarm whenever it
is detected that two similar inputs from the past led to dissimilar outputs.
  This way, monitoring will complement existing offline ``robustification''
approaches to increase the trustworthiness of AI decision-makers.
  We show that the monitoring problem can be cast as the fixed-radius nearest
neighbor (FRNN) search problem, which, despite being well-studied, lacks
suitable online solutions.
  We present our tool Clemont, which offers a number of lightweight monitors,
some of which use upgraded online variants of existing FRNN algorithms, and one
uses a novel algorithm based on binary decision diagrams -- a data-structure
commonly used in software and hardware verification.
  We have also developed an efficient parallelization technique that can
substantially cut down the computation time of monitors for which the distance
between input-output pairs is measured using the $L_\infty$ norm.
  Using standard benchmarks from the literature of adversarial and semantic
robustness and individual fairness, we perform a comparative study of different
monitors in \tool, and demonstrate their effectiveness in correctly detecting
robustness violations at runtime.

Abstract: Understanding urban socioeconomic conditions through visual data is a
challenging yet essential task for sustainable urban development and policy
planning. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{CityLens}$, a comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of large language-vision models
(LLVMs) in predicting socioeconomic indicators from satellite and street view

life. Based on this dataset, we define 11 prediction tasks and utilize three
evaluation paradigms: Direct Metric Prediction, Normalized Metric Estimation,
and Feature-Based Regression. We benchmark 17 state-of-the-art LLVMs across
these tasks. Our results reveal that while LLVMs demonstrate promising
perceptual and reasoning capabilities, they still exhibit limitations in
predicting urban socioeconomic indicators. CityLens provides a unified
framework for diagnosing these limitations and guiding future efforts in using
LLVMs to understand and predict urban socioeconomic patterns. Our codes and

Abstract: Directly training Large Language Models (LLMs) for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)
remains challenging due to intricate reward modeling, dynamic agent
interactions, and demanding generalization requirements. This paper explores
whether post-training techniques, specifically Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), can effectively
$\textit{generalize}$ to multi-agent scenarios. We use economic reasoning as a

demand for structured analytical reasoning, and its relevance to real-world
applications such as market design, resource allocation, and policy analysis.
We introduce $\textbf{Recon}$ ($\textbf{R}$easoning like an

TL;DR: 论文研究了LLM在QA任务中的自信度表现，发现其与人类不同且存在刻板偏见，提出AFCE方法以改善自信度校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在任务中容易低估或高估自信度，研究LLM是否表现出类似行为及其差异。

Method: 测试三种LLM在不同难度QA任务中的自信度，提出AFCE方法分阶段评估自信度和答案。

Result: LLM对任务难度不敏感且存在刻板偏见，AFCE显著减少过度自信并更接近人类表现。

Conclusion: AFCE能有效改善LLM的自信度校准和可解释性。

Abstract: Psychology research has shown that humans are poor at estimating their
performance on tasks, tending towards underconfidence on easy tasks and
overconfidence on difficult tasks. We examine three LLMs, Llama-3-70B-instruct,
Claude-3-Sonnet, and GPT-4o, on a range of QA tasks of varying difficulty, and
show that models exhibit subtle differences from human patterns of
overconfidence: less sensitive to task difficulty, and when prompted to answer
based on different personas -- e.g., expert vs layman, or different race,
gender, and ages -- the models will respond with stereotypically biased
confidence estimations even though their underlying answer accuracy remains the
same. Based on these observations, we propose Answer-Free Confidence Estimation
(AFCE) to improve confidence calibration and LLM interpretability in these
settings. AFCE is a self-assessment method that employs two stages of
prompting, first eliciting only confidence scores on questions, then asking
separately for the answer. Experiments on the MMLU and GPQA datasets spanning
subjects and difficulty show that this separation of tasks significantly
reduces overconfidence and delivers more human-like sensitivity to task
difficulty.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了RIOSWorld基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLM）在真实计算机操作中的安全风险，发现当前计算机使用代理存在显著风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在评估MLLM计算机使用代理的安全风险时，缺乏真实交互环境或仅关注少数风险类型，无法全面反映现实复杂性。

Method: 提出RIOSWorld基准，包含492个跨多种计算机应用的风险任务，分为用户源风险和环境风险两类，并从风险意图和完成度两个角度评估。

Result: 实验表明，当前计算机使用代理在真实场景中面临显著安全风险。

Conclusion: 研究强调了计算机使用代理在真实操作中安全对齐的必要性和紧迫性，为开发可信代理提供了重要见解。

Abstract: With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they
are increasingly deployed as autonomous computer-use agents capable of
accomplishing complex computer tasks. However, a pressing issue arises: Can the
safety risk principles designed and aligned for general MLLMs in dialogue
scenarios be effectively transferred to real-world computer-use scenarios?
Existing research on evaluating the safety risks of MLLM-based computer-use
agents suffers from several limitations: it either lacks realistic interactive
environments, or narrowly focuses on one or a few specific risk types. These
limitations ignore the complexity, variability, and diversity of real-world
environments, thereby restricting comprehensive risk evaluation for
computer-use agents. To this end, we introduce \textbf{RiOSWorld}, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the potential risks of MLLM-based agents during real-world
computer manipulations. Our benchmark includes 492 risky tasks spanning various
computer applications, involving web, social media, multimedia, os, email, and
office software. We categorize these risks into two major classes based on
their risk source: (i) User-originated risks and (ii) Environmental risks. For
the evaluation, we evaluate safety risks from two perspectives: (i) Risk goal
intention and (ii) Risk goal completion. Extensive experiments with multimodal
agents on \textbf{RiOSWorld} demonstrate that current computer-use agents
confront significant safety risks in real-world scenarios. Our findings
highlight the necessity and urgency of safety alignment for computer-use agents
in real-world computer manipulation, providing valuable insights for developing
trustworthy computer-use agents. Our benchmark is publicly available at
https://yjyddq.github.io/RiOSWorld.github.io/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于规则或LLM的评估器在逐步行动中容易遗漏危险、忽略细微含义、未能发现小问题的累积，且对模糊的安全或安全规则感到困惑。

Method: \sys通过构建经验记忆，提取结构化语义特征并生成推理链，采用多阶段、上下文感知的检索增强生成过程来指导评估新案例。

Result: 实验表明，\sys在所有基准测试中均提升了LLM的评估性能，并在安全和安全风险评估中达到了人类级别的准确性。

Conclusion: \sys为解决LLM代理的安全和安全性评估挑战提供了一种有效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancement of LLM-based agents, the reliable evaluation of
their safety and security remains a significant challenge. Existing rule-based
or LLM-based evaluators often miss dangers in agents' step-by-step actions,
overlook subtle meanings, fail to see how small issues compound, and get
confused by unclear safety or security rules. To overcome this evaluation
crisis, we introduce \sys, a universal, training-free, memory-augmented
reasoning framework that empowers LLM evaluators to emulate human expert
evaluators. \sys constructs an experiential memory by having an LLM adaptively
extract structured semantic features (e.g., scenario, risk, behavior) and
generate associated chain-of-thought reasoning traces for past interactions. A
multi-stage, context-aware retrieval-augmented generation process then
dynamically retrieves the most relevant reasoning experiences to guide the LLM
evaluator's assessment of new cases. Moreover, we developed \data, the first
benchmark designed to check how well LLM-based evaluators can spot both safety
risks and security threats. \data comprises \textbf{2293} meticulously
annotated interaction records, covering \textbf{15} risk types across
\textbf{29} application scenarios. A key feature of \data is its nuanced
approach to ambiguous risk situations, employing ``Strict'' and ``Lenient''
judgment standards. Experiments demonstrate that \sys not only consistently
improves the evaluation performance of LLMs across all benchmarks but also sets
a new state-of-the-art in LLM-as-a-judge for agent safety and security,
achieving human-level accuracy. Our work is openly openly accessible.

Motivation: 传统本体创建依赖专家手动完成，耗时且易出错，难以应对大规模动态知识领域。

Method: OntoRAG整合了网络爬取、PDF解析、混合分块、信息提取、知识图谱构建和本体创建等技术。

Result: 实验显示，OntoRAG在全面性上优于传统方法，对向量RAG的胜率为85%，对GraphRAG为75%。

Conclusion: OntoRAG解决了本体自动化的关键挑战，推动了语义网的愿景。

Abstract: Ontologies are pivotal for structuring knowledge bases to enhance question
answering (QA) systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
traditional ontology creation relies on manual efforts by domain experts, a
process that is time intensive, error prone, and impractical for large, dynamic
knowledge domains. This paper introduces OntoRAG, an automated pipeline
designed to derive ontologies from unstructured knowledge bases, with a focus
on electrical relay documents. OntoRAG integrates advanced techniques,
including web scraping, PDF parsing, hybrid chunking, information extraction,
knowledge graph construction, and ontology creation, to transform unstructured
data into a queryable ontology. By leveraging LLMs and graph based methods,
OntoRAG enhances global sensemaking capabilities, outperforming conventional
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG approaches in
comprehensiveness and diversity. Experimental results demonstrate OntoRAGs
effectiveness, achieving a comprehensiveness win rate of 85% against vector RAG
and 75% against GraphRAGs best configuration. This work addresses the critical
challenge of automating ontology creation, advancing the vision of the semantic
web.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将图结构编码为文本形式，未能充分利用LLM对图结构的感知和推理能力。

Method: DrKGC通过轻量级模型学习结构嵌入和逻辑规则，采用自底向上的图检索方法提取子图，并通过GCN适配器增强嵌入，最终整合到LLM的提示中进行微调。

Result: 在两个通用领域和两个生物医学数据集上表现出优越性能，生物医学案例研究验证了其可解释性和实用性。

Conclusion: DrKGC通过动态子图检索和LLM结合，显著提升了知识图谱补全的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing triples in knowledge
graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing triples and textual information. Recently,
generative large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for
graph tasks. However, current approaches typically encode graph context in
textual form, which fails to fully exploit the potential of LLMs for perceiving
and reasoning about graph structures. To address this limitation, we propose
DrKGC (Dynamic Subgraph Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Knowledge Graph
Completion). DrKGC employs a flexible lightweight model training strategy to
learn structural embeddings and logical rules within the KG. It then leverages
a novel bottom-up graph retrieval method to extract a subgraph for each query
guided by the learned rules. Finally, a graph convolutional network (GCN)
adapter uses the retrieved subgraph to enhance the structural embeddings, which
are then integrated into the prompt for effective LLM fine-tuning. Experimental
results on two general domain benchmark datasets and two biomedical datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of DrKGC. Furthermore, a realistic case
study in the biomedical domain highlights its interpretability and practical
utility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的行为与人类价值观的对齐至关重要，但其陈述偏好与情境决策中的偏好偏差问题尚未充分研究，这对模型的解释性、可信度和伦理部署提出了挑战。

Method: 通过设计一系列强制二元选择的提示数据集，比较LLMs在通用原则提示（陈述偏好）和情境化提示（揭示偏好）中的响应，使用KL散度等指标量化偏差。

Result: 研究发现，提示格式的微小变化常导致偏好反转，且这种现象在不同偏好类别和主流LLMs中普遍存在。

Conclusion: 该研究对LLMs在服务中的集成至关重要，尤其是在需要道德、公平和社会责任的场景中，同时也为LLMs在自主代理任务中的应用提供了重要警示。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) highlight the need to align
their behaviors with human values. A critical, yet understudied, issue is the
potential divergence between an LLM's stated preferences (its reported
alignment with general principles) and its revealed preferences (inferred from
decisions in contextualized scenarios). Such deviations raise fundamental
concerns for the interpretability, trustworthiness, reasoning transparency, and
ethical deployment of LLMs, particularly in high-stakes applications. This work
formally defines and proposes a method to measure this preference deviation. We
investigate how LLMs may activate different guiding principles in specific
contexts, leading to choices that diverge from previously stated general
principles. Our approach involves crafting a rich dataset of well-designed
prompts as a series of forced binary choices and presenting them to LLMs. We
compare LLM responses to general principle prompts stated preference with LLM
responses to contextualized prompts revealed preference, using metrics like KL
divergence to quantify the deviation. We repeat the analysis across different
categories of preferences and on four mainstream LLMs and find that a minor
change in prompt format can often pivot the preferred choice regardless of the
preference categories and LLMs in the test. This prevalent phenomenon
highlights the lack of understanding and control of the LLM decision-making
competence. Our study will be crucial for integrating LLMs into services,
especially those that interact directly with humans, where morality, fairness,
and social responsibilities are crucial dimensions. Furthermore, identifying or
being aware of such deviation will be critically important as LLMs are
increasingly envisioned for autonomous agentic tasks where continuous human
evaluation of all LLMs' intermediary decision-making steps is impossible.

Abstract: Accurate house-price forecasting is essential for investors, planners, and
researchers. However, reproducible benchmarks with sufficient spatiotemporal

address this, we introduce HouseTS a large scale, multimodal dataset covering
monthly house prices from March 2012 to December 2023 across 6,000 ZIP codes in
30 major U.S. metropolitan areas. The dataset includes over 890K records,
enriched with points of Interest (POI), socioeconomic indicators, and detailed
real estate metrics. To establish standardized performance baselines, we
evaluate 14 models, spanning classical statistical approaches, deep neural
networks (DNNs), and pretrained time-series foundation models. We further
demonstrate the value of HouseTS in a multimodal case study, where a vision
language model extracts structured textual descriptions of geographic change
from time stamped satellite imagery. This enables interpretable, grounded
insights into urban evolution. HouseTS is hosted on Kaggle, while all
preprocessing pipelines, benchmark code, and documentation are openly
maintained on GitHub to ensure full reproducibility and easy adoption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在不确定场景中常表现出过度自信，现有解决方案（如回避回答）未能有效识别和处理不确定性。

Method: 引入ConfuseBench基准，分析三类不确定性（文档稀缺、能力限制、查询模糊性），生成上下文感知查询，并使用InteractDPO训练方法。

Result: 实验表明当前LLMs难以准确识别不确定性根源，倾向于归因于查询模糊性。提出的方法显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 通过上下文感知查询和InteractDPO训练，能有效提升LLMs识别和处理不确定性的能力。

Abstract: Despite the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) across
various domains, they frequently exhibit overconfidence when encountering
uncertain scenarios, yet existing solutions primarily rely on evasive responses
(e.g., "I don't know") overlooks the opportunity of identifying and addressing
the uncertainty to generate more satisfactory responses. To systematically
investigate and improve LLMs' ability of recognizing and addressing the source
of uncertainty, we introduce \textbf{ConfuseBench}, a benchmark mainly focus on
three types of uncertainty: document scarcity, limited capability, and query
ambiguity. Experiments with ConfuseBench reveal that current LLMs struggle to
accurately identify the root cause of uncertainty and solve it. They prefer to
attribute uncertainty to query ambiguity while overlooking capability
limitations, especially for those weaker models. To tackle this challenge, we
first generate context-aware inquiries that highlight the confusing aspect of
the original query. Then we judge the source of uncertainty based on the
uniqueness of the inquiry's answer. Further we use an on-policy training
method, InteractDPO to generate better inquiries. Experimental results
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，越狱攻击成为迫切问题，需要一种高效的方法来主动发现模型的安全风险。

Result: CoP框架显著提升了单轮攻击成功率，最高达19倍，并发现了新的安全漏洞。

Conclusion: CoP框架为LLMs的红队测试提供了统一且可扩展的自动化解决方案，显著提升了安全风险发现能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred transformative
applications in various domains, ranging from open-source to proprietary LLMs.
However, jailbreak attacks, which aim to break safety alignment and user
compliance by tricking the target LLMs into answering harmful and risky
responses, are becoming an urgent concern. The practice of red-teaming for LLMs
is to proactively explore potential risks and error-prone instances before the
release of frontier AI technology. This paper proposes an agentic workflow to
automate and scale the red-teaming process of LLMs through the
Composition-of-Principles (CoP) framework, where human users provide a set of
red-teaming principles as instructions to an AI agent to automatically
orchestrate effective red-teaming strategies and generate jailbreak prompts.
Distinct from existing red-teaming methods, our CoP framework provides a
unified and extensible framework to encompass and orchestrate human-provided
red-teaming principles to enable the automated discovery of new red-teaming
strategies. When tested against leading LLMs, CoP reveals unprecedented safety
risks by finding novel jailbreak prompts and improving the best-known
single-turn attack success rate by up to 19.0 times.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多样性和有效性上优于现有方法，显著提高了红队探索的效率。

Conclusion: 该工作为自动化红队提供了新视角，并显著提升了攻击提示的生成效率。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in power and influence, ensuring their
safety and preventing harmful output becomes critical. Automated red teaming
serves as a tool to detect security vulnerabilities in LLMs without manual
labor. However, most existing methods struggle to balance the effectiveness and
diversity of red-team generated attack prompts. To address this challenge, we
propose \ourapproach, a novel automated red teaming training framework that
utilizes reinforcement learning to explore and generate more effective attack
prompts while balancing their diversity. Specifically, it consists of three
training stages: (1) Cold Start: The red team model is supervised and
fine-tuned on a jailbreak dataset obtained through imitation learning. (2)
Warm-up Exploration: The model is trained in jailbreak instruction following
and exploration, using diversity and consistency as reward signals. (3)
Enhanced Jailbreak: Progressive jailbreak rewards are introduced to gradually
enhance the jailbreak performance of the red-team model. Extensive experiments
on a variety of LLMs show that \ourapproach effectively balances the diversity
and effectiveness of jailbreak prompts compared to existing methods. Our work
significantly improves the efficiency of red team exploration and provides a
new perspective on automated red teaming.

Motivation: 当前MLLMs在地理推理任务中存在视觉基础薄弱、推理不稳定和定位不准确等问题，GeoChain旨在提供一个全面的诊断工具以推动MLLMs在复杂地理推理中的进步。

Method: 利用Mapillary街景图像构建21步链式推理问题序列，并标注语义分割和视觉可定位性分数，测试多种MLLMs在2088张图像子集上的表现。

Result: 测试显示MLLMs在视觉基础、推理稳定性和精确定位方面存在显著挑战，尤其在推理复杂度增加时表现更差。

Conclusion: GeoChain为MLLMs在复杂地理推理任务中的改进提供了关键诊断方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces GeoChain, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating
step-by-step geographic reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
Leveraging 1.46 million Mapillary street-level images, GeoChain pairs each
image with a 21-step chain-of-thought (CoT) question sequence (over 30 million
Q&A pairs). These sequences guide models from coarse attributes to fine-grained
localization across four reasoning categories - visual, spatial, cultural, and
precise geolocation - annotated by difficulty. Images are also enriched with
semantic segmentation (150 classes) and a visual locatability score. Our
benchmarking of contemporary MLLMs (GPT-4.1 variants, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5
variants) on a diverse 2,088-image subset reveals consistent challenges: models
frequently exhibit weaknesses in visual grounding, display erratic reasoning,
and struggle to achieve accurate localization, especially as the reasoning
complexity escalates. GeoChain offers a robust diagnostic methodology, critical
for fostering significant advancements in complex geographic reasoning within
MLLMs.

Abstract: Many promising-looking ideas in AI research fail to deliver, but their
validation takes substantial human labor and compute. Predicting an idea's
chance of success is thus crucial for accelerating empirical AI research, a
skill that even expert researchers can only acquire through substantial
experience. We build the first benchmark for this task and compare LMs with
human experts. Concretely, given two research ideas (e.g., two jailbreaking
methods), we aim to predict which will perform better on a set of benchmarks.
We scrape ideas and experimental results from conference papers, yielding 1,585
human-verified idea pairs published after our base model's cut-off date for
testing, and 6,000 pairs for training. We then develop a system that combines a
fine-tuned GPT-4.1 with a paper retrieval agent, and we recruit 25 human
experts to compare with. In the NLP domain, our system beats human experts by a
large margin (64.4% v.s. 48.9%). On the full test set, our system achieves 77%
accuracy, while off-the-shelf frontier LMs like o3 perform no better than
random guessing, even with the same retrieval augmentation. We verify that our
system does not exploit superficial features like idea complexity through
extensive human-written and LM-designed robustness tests. Finally, we evaluate
our system on unpublished novel ideas, including ideas generated by an AI
ideation agent. Our system achieves 63.6% accuracy, demonstrating its potential
as a reward model for improving idea generation models. Altogether, our results
outline a promising new direction for LMs to accelerate empirical AI research.

TL;DR: ReasonTSC是一个新颖的框架，通过多轮推理和融合决策策略，有效利用大语言模型（LLM）的推理能力进行时间序列分类（TSC），显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在文本领域表现出色，但其在时间序列分类任务中的直接应用效果有限，因此需要一种专门的方法来利用LLM的推理能力。

Method: ReasonTSC通过多轮推理和融合决策策略，引导LLM思考时间序列数据的特性，并结合插件分类器的预测和置信度分数，进行结构化推理。

Result: 实验表明，ReasonTSC在性能上优于现有时间序列推理基线和插件模型，并能纠正插件模型的错误预测。

Conclusion: ReasonTSC为时间序列分类任务提供了一种有效的LLM推理方法，展示了其在复杂任务中的潜力。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have significantly
advanced their performance by enabling in-depth understanding of diverse tasks.
With growing interest in applying LLMs to the time series domain, this has
proven nontrivial, as evidenced by the limited efficacy of straightforwardly
adapting text-domain reasoning techniques. Although recent work has shown
promise in several time series tasks, further leveraging advancements in LLM
reasoning remains under-explored for time series classification (TSC) tasks,
despite their prevalence and significance in many real-world applications. In
this paper, we propose ReasonTSC, a novel framework designed to effectively
leverage LLM reasoning for time series classification through both a multi-turn
reasoning and a fused decision-making strategy tailored to TSC. Rather than
straightforwardly applying existing reasoning techniques or relying solely on
LLMs' built-in reasoning capabilities, ReasonTSC first steers the model to
think over the essential characteristics of time series data. Next, it
integrates predictions and confidence scores from plug-in classifiers, e.g.,
domain-specific time series models, as in-context examples. Finally, ReasonTSC
guides the LLM through a structured reasoning process: it evaluates the initial
assessment, backtracks to consider alternative hypotheses, and compares their
merits before arriving at a final classification. Extensive experiments and
systematic ablation studies demonstrate that ReasonTSC consistently outperforms
both existing time series reasoning baselines and plug-in models, and is even
capable of identifying and correcting plug-in models' false predictions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于偏好学习的细粒度视频描述方法SynPO，通过优化偏好对构建和训练效率，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉视频的细微动态和丰富细节，直接偏好优化（DPO）存在局限性。

Method: 提出偏好对构建管道和Synergistic Preference Optimization（SynPO）方法，避免负面偏好主导优化并保留语言能力。

Result: 在视频描述和NLP任务中，SynPO均优于DPO变体，训练效率提升20%。

Conclusion: SynPO为细粒度视频描述提供了一种高效且性能优越的优化方法。

Abstract: Fine-grained video captioning aims to generate detailed, temporally coherent
descriptions of video content. However, existing methods struggle to capture
subtle video dynamics and rich detailed information. In this paper, we leverage
preference learning to enhance the performance of vision-language models in
fine-grained video captioning, while mitigating several limitations inherent to
direct preference optimization (DPO). First, we propose a pipeline for
constructing preference pairs that leverages the intrinsic properties of VLMs
along with partial assistance from large language models, achieving an optimal
balance between cost and data quality. Second, we propose Synergistic
Preference Optimization (SynPO), a novel optimization method offering
significant advantages over DPO and its variants. SynPO prevents negative
preferences from dominating the optimization, explicitly preserves the model's
language capability to avoid deviation of the optimization objective, and
improves training efficiency by eliminating the need for the reference model.
We extensively evaluate SynPO not only on video captioning benchmarks (e.g.,
VDC, VDD, VATEX) but also across well-established NLP tasks, including general
language understanding and preference evaluation, using diverse pretrained
models. Results demonstrate that SynPO consistently outperforms DPO variants
while achieving 20\% improvement in training efficiency. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决医疗领域劳动力不足和成本上升的问题，同时开发系统性评估基准以指导技术发展。

Method: 通过标准化流程从医学教科书中提取多模态数据，生成5000个临床相关问题，并采用多层级注释系统分类。

Result: 评估了多种MLLM模型，发现不同任务和模型类别间存在显著性能差异。

Conclusion: MedBookVQA为临床AI提供了关键评估工具，揭示了GMAI系统的局限性，并推动了医学领域的多模态基准测试发展。

Abstract: The accelerating development of general medical artificial intelligence
(GMAI), powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs), offers
transformative potential for addressing persistent healthcare challenges,
including workforce deficits and escalating costs. The parallel development of
systematic evaluation benchmarks emerges as a critical imperative to enable
performance assessment and provide technological guidance. Meanwhile, as an
invaluable knowledge source, the potential of medical textbooks for benchmark
development remains underexploited. Here, we present MedBookVQA, a systematic
and comprehensive multimodal benchmark derived from open-access medical
textbooks. To curate this benchmark, we propose a standardized pipeline for
automated extraction of medical figures while contextually aligning them with
corresponding medical narratives. Based on this curated data, we generate 5,000
clinically relevant questions spanning modality recognition, disease
classification, anatomical identification, symptom diagnosis, and surgical
procedures. A multi-tier annotation system categorizes queries through
hierarchical taxonomies encompassing medical imaging modalities (42
categories), body anatomies (125 structures), and clinical specialties (31
departments), enabling nuanced analysis across medical subdomains. We evaluate
a wide array of MLLMs, including proprietary, open-sourced, medical, and
reasoning models, revealing significant performance disparities across task
types and model categories. Our findings highlight critical capability gaps in
current GMAI systems while establishing textbook-derived multimodal benchmarks
as essential evaluation tools. MedBookVQA establishes textbook-derived
benchmarking as a critical paradigm for advancing clinical AI, exposing
limitations in GMAI systems while providing anatomically structured performance
metrics across specialties.

Motivation: 多模态情感识别（MER）在人类-计算机交互中起关键作用，但现有注意力融合方法在模态特异性特征提取和跨模态相似性捕获方面仍存在挑战。

Method: 提出门控交互注意力机制自适应提取模态特异性特征，并通过成对交互增强情感信息；引入模态不变生成器学习模态不变表示，通过对齐跨模态相似性约束域偏移。

Result: 在IEMOCAP数据集上，WA达到80.7%，UA达到81.3%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MER中的关键挑战，提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) extracts emotions from multimodal data,
including visual, speech, and text inputs, playing a key role in human-computer
interaction. Attention-based fusion methods dominate MER research, achieving
strong classification performance. However, two key challenges remain:
effectively extracting modality-specific features and capturing cross-modal
similarities despite distribution differences caused by modality heterogeneity.
To address these, we propose a gated interactive attention mechanism to
adaptively extract modality-specific features while enhancing emotional
information through pairwise interactions. Additionally, we introduce a
modality-invariant generator to learn modality-invariant representations and
constrain domain shifts by aligning cross-modal similarities. Experiments on
IEMOCAP demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MER
approaches, achieving WA 80.7% and UA 81.3%.

<details>

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）逐渐发展为自主代理，其认知基础问题仍未解决，如代理的定义、决策方式及行为目标。本文旨在为代理提供一个连贯的认知框架。

Method: 提出了一种统一理论，将内部推理和外部行为视为等效的认知工具，并主张将代理的工具使用决策边界与其知识边界对齐。

Result: 通过这一框架，代理能够系统协调内省与交互，减少不必要的工具使用，提升认知效率。

Conclusion: 这一视角将代理设计从单纯的行为执行者转变为知识驱动的智能系统，为实现自适应、高效和目标导向的行为提供了理论基础。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve into increasingly autonomous agents,
fundamental questions about their epistemic foundations remain unresolved: What
defines an agent? How should it make decisions? And what objectives should
guide its behavior? In this position paper, we argue that true autonomy
requires agents to be grounded in a coherent epistemic framework that governs
what they know, what they need to know, and how to acquire that knowledge
efficiently. We propose a unified theory that treats internal reasoning and
external actions as equivalent epistemic tools, enabling agents to
systematically coordinate introspection and interaction. Building on this
framework, we advocate for aligning an agent's tool use decision-making
boundary with its knowledge boundary, thereby minimizing unnecessary tool use
and maximizing epistemic efficiency. This perspective shifts the design of
agents from mere action executors to knowledge-driven intelligence systems,
offering a principled path toward building foundation agents capable of
adaptive, efficient, and goal-directed behavior.

TL;DR: Conformal Arbitrage 是一种后处理框架，通过数据驱动的阈值在主要模型和保守的 Guardian 之间进行调解，确保不良事件的频率不超过用户指定的配额。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型部署需要平衡多个竞争目标（如帮助性与无害性、成本与准确性、奖励与安全性），因此需要一种理论支持且实用的工具。

Method: 使用 Conformal Arbitrage 框架，通过校准阈值（基于 conformal risk control）在主要模型和 Guardian 之间动态路由，无需修改模型权重。

Result: 该方法在准确性和成本上优于随机路由，能够高效平衡多个目标。

Conclusion: Conformal Arbitrage 是一种实用且理论可靠的工具，适用于大规模语言模型的部署，尤其是在竞争目标场景下。

Abstract: Modern language model deployments must often balance competing objectives,
for example, helpfulness versus harmlessness, cost versus accuracy, and reward
versus safety. We introduce Conformal Arbitrage, a post hoc framework that
learns a data driven threshold to mediate between a Primary model optimized for
a primary objective and a more conservative Guardian which could be another
model or a human domain expert aligned with a guardrail objective. The
threshold is calibrated with conformal risk control, yielding finite sample,
distribution free guarantees that the long run frequency of undesirable events,
such as factual errors or safety violations, does not exceed a user specified
quota. Because Conformal Arbitrage operates wholly at the API level, without
requiring access to model logits or updating model weights, it complements
weight based alignment techniques and integrates seamlessly with existing cost
aware cascades. Empirically, Conformal Arbitrage traces an efficient frontier,
allowing users to define an acceptable performance level for one objective
while maximizing utility in another. We observe that our method outperforms, in
terms of accuracy, cost matched random routing between models. These properties
make Conformal Arbitrage a practical, theoretically grounded tool for
trustworthy and economical deployment of large language models across a broad
range of potentially competing objectives.

Motivation: 由于不同背景的人对VLM助手有不同期望，需要将其与个性化情境认知对齐。

Method: 通过社会学角色集简化问题，构建PCogAlignBench基准（18k实例，20个角色集），并提出PCogAlign框架（基于认知和动作的奖励模型）。

Result: 实验和人工评估验证了PCogAlignBench的可靠性和PCogAlign的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文提出了个性化对齐VLM的方法，并开源了基准和代码。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) aligned with general human objectives, such as
being harmless and hallucination-free, have become valuable assistants of
humans in managing visual tasks. However, people with diversified backgrounds
have different cognition even in the same situation. Consequently, they may
have personalized expectations for VLM assistants. This highlights the urgent
need to align VLM assistants with personalized situated cognition for
real-world assistance. To study this problem, we first simplify it by
characterizing individuals based on the sociological concept of Role-Set. Then,
we propose to evaluate the individuals' actions to examine whether the
personalized alignment is achieved. Further, we construct a benchmark named
PCogAlignBench, which includes 18k instances and 20 individuals with different
Role-Sets. Finally, we present a framework called PCogAlign, which constructs a
cognition-aware and action-based reward model for personalized alignment.
Experimental results and human evaluations demonstrate the reliability of the
PCogAlignBench and the effectiveness of our proposed PCogAlign. We will
open-source the constructed benchmark and code at

Result: MARS成功生成与对话输入对应的文本和非语言内容，VENUS数据集被验证为规模大且高效。

Abstract: Nonverbal communication is integral to human interaction, with gestures,
facial expressions, and body language conveying critical aspects of intent and
emotion. However, existing large language models (LLMs) fail to effectively
incorporate these nonverbal elements, limiting their capacity to create fully
immersive conversational experiences. We introduce MARS, a multimodal language
model designed to understand and generate nonverbal cues alongside text,
bridging this gap in conversational AI. Our key innovation is VENUS, a
large-scale dataset comprising annotated videos with time-aligned text, facial
expressions, and body language. Leveraging VENUS, we train MARS with a
next-token prediction objective, combining text with vector-quantized nonverbal
representations to achieve multimodal understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Based on various analyses of the VENUS datasets, we validate
its substantial scale and high effectiveness. Our quantitative and qualitative
results demonstrate that MARS successfully generates text and nonverbal
languages, corresponding to conversational input.

TL;DR: FLEx是一个针对MoE架构LLMs的联邦学习框架，通过个性化专家剪枝和自适应门控机制，优化通信和计算成本，提升非IID数据下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前联邦学习方法无法直接利用MoE架构的稀疏性，导致通信和计算成本过高，限制了知识共享的潜力。

Method: FLEx通过剪枝保留每个客户端一个专家，并使用自适应门控机制将个性化专家整合到预训练的MoE层中。

Result: 在非IID数据下，FLEx表现优于现有联邦学习基线。

Conclusion: FLEx为MoE架构的LLMs提供了一种高效、个性化的联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a prominent strategy
for scaling large language models (LLMs), effectively leveraging sparse
activation and facilitating task-specific personalization. However, current
federated learning (FL) approaches are primarily designed for dense models,
making them unable to directly exploit the sparsity inherent in MoE
architectures. Treating MoE models as dense networks in federated scenarios
results in excessive communication overhead and computational costs,
undermining the potential for personalized knowledge sharing. To address these
challenges, we propose FLEx (Federated LLMs with Personalized Experts), a novel
federated learning framework explicitly tailored for MoE-based LLMs. FLEx
efficiently personalizes by pruning the global MoE model to keep only one
expert per client, and employs an adaptive gating mechanism to reintegrate
these personalized experts into the pre-trained MoE layers, ensuring the
original backbone architecture remains unchanged. These personalized experts
are trained with local data and stored locally on each client, while the shared
modules are aggregated globally. Extensive evaluations on diverse
instruction-based datasets under non-IID conditions consistently demonstrate
that FLEx outperforms existing federated baselines. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流WSD方法在语义表示和计算效率上存在不足，PolyBERT旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用多编码器融合局部与全局语义，引入BCL减少冗余训练输入。

Result: PolyBERT在F1分数上优于基线方法2%，BCL减少37.6%的GPU时间。

Conclusion: PolyBERT通过改进语义表示和计算效率，显著提升WSD性能。

Abstract: Mainstream Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) approaches have employed BERT to
extract semantics from both context and definitions of senses to determine the
most suitable sense of a target word, achieving notable performance. However,
there are two limitations in these approaches. First, previous studies failed
to balance the representation of token-level (local) and sequence-level
(global) semantics during feature extraction, leading to insufficient semantic
representation and a performance bottleneck. Second, these approaches
incorporated all possible senses of each target word during the training phase,
leading to unnecessary computational costs. To overcome these limitations, this
paper introduces a poly-encoder BERT-based model with batch contrastive
learning for WSD, named PolyBERT. Compared with previous WSD methods, PolyBERT
has two improvements: (1) A poly-encoder with a multi-head attention mechanism
is utilized to fuse token-level (local) and sequence-level (global) semantics,
rather than focusing on just one. This approach enriches semantic
representation by balancing local and global semantics. (2) To avoid redundant
training inputs, Batch Contrastive Learning (BCL) is introduced. BCL utilizes
the correct senses of other target words in the same batch as negative samples
for the current target word, which reduces training inputs and computational
cost. The experimental results demonstrate that PolyBERT outperforms baseline
WSD methods such as Huang's GlossBERT and Blevins's BEM by 2\% in F1-score. In
addition, PolyBERT with BCL reduces GPU hours by 37.6\% compared with PolyBERT
without BCL.

Motivation: 现有基于图的社交机器人检测方法依赖标签且泛化能力差，生成式图自监督学习（GSL）虽有望解决这些问题，但现有方法受限于同质性假设，无法捕捉全局模式。

Method: BotHP采用双编码器架构，分别捕获节点共性和独特性，同时建模同质性和异质性，并通过原型引导的集群发现任务建模全局一致性。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验表明，BotHP显著提升了检测性能，减少了对标签的依赖，并增强了泛化能力。

Conclusion: BotHP通过异质性感知和原型引导的集群发现，有效解决了社交机器人检测中的交互伪装和分布式部署问题。

Abstract: Detecting social media bots is essential for maintaining the security and
trustworthiness of social networks. While contemporary graph-based detection
methods demonstrate promising results, their practical application is limited
by label reliance and poor generalization capability across diverse
communities. Generative Graph Self-Supervised Learning (GSL) presents a
promising paradigm to overcome these limitations, yet existing approaches
predominantly follow the homophily assumption and fail to capture the global
patterns in the graph, which potentially diminishes their effectiveness when
facing the challenges of interaction camouflage and distributed deployment in
bot detection scenarios. To this end, we propose BotHP, a generative GSL
framework tailored to boost graph-based bot detectors through heterophily-aware
representation learning and prototype-guided cluster discovery. Specifically,
BotHP leverages a dual-encoder architecture, consisting of a graph-aware
encoder to capture node commonality and a graph-agnostic encoder to preserve
node uniqueness. This enables the simultaneous modeling of both homophily and
heterophily, effectively countering the interaction camouflage issue.
Additionally, BotHP incorporates a prototype-guided cluster discovery pretext
task to model the latent global consistency of bot clusters and identify
spatially dispersed yet semantically aligned bot collectives. Extensive
experiments on two real-world bot detection benchmarks demonstrate that BotHP
consistently boosts graph-based bot detectors, improving detection performance,
alleviating label reliance, and enhancing generalization capability.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In ethics, individual responsibility is often defined through Frankfurt's
principle of alternative possibilities. This definition is not adequate in a
group decision-making setting because it often results in the lack of a
responsible party or "responsibility gap''. One of the existing approaches to
address this problem is to consider group responsibility. Another, recently
proposed, approach is "higher-order'' responsibility. The paper considers the
problem of deciding if higher-order responsibility up to degree $d$ is enough
to close the responsibility gap. The main technical result is that this problem
is $\Pi_{2d+1}$-complete.

Method: 利用Item Response Theory建模LLM能力与查询属性的关系，并结合在线查询预热技术。

Result: 在20个LLM和12个数据集上的实验表明，IRT-Router在效果和可解释性上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: IRT-Router在冷启动场景中表现优异，证明了其在实际应用中的可靠性和实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across
a wide range of natural language tasks. However, selecting the optimal LLM to
respond to a user query often necessitates a delicate balance between
performance and cost. While powerful models deliver better results, they come
at a high cost, whereas smaller models are more cost-effective but less
capable. To address this trade-off, we propose IRT-Router, a multi-LLM routing
framework that efficiently routes user queries to the most suitable LLM.
Inspired by Item Response Theory (IRT), a psychological measurement
methodology, IRT-Router explicitly models the relationship between LLM
capabilities and user query attributes. This not only enables accurate
prediction of response performance but also provides interpretable insights,
such as LLM abilities and query difficulty. Additionally, we design an online
query warm-up technique based on semantic similarity, further enhancing the
online generalization capability of IRT-Router. Extensive experiments on 20
LLMs and 12 datasets demonstrate that IRT-Router outperforms most baseline
methods in terms of effectiveness and interpretability. Its superior
performance in cold-start scenarios further confirms the reliability and
practicality of IRT-Router in real-world applications. Code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 传统方法将大量工具模式注入提示中成本高且易出错，需要一种更高效的方式让LLM自主检索工具。

Method: MCP-Zero包含三个组件：主动工具请求、分层向量路由和迭代主动调用，支持多轮跨域工具链构建。

Conclusion: MCP-Zero显著提升了工具检索效率和准确性，支持多轮调用，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Function-calling has enabled large language models (LLMs) to act as
tool-using agents, but injecting thousands of tool schemas into the prompt is
costly and error-prone. We introduce MCP-Zero, a proactive agent framework that
lets the LLM itself decide when and which external tools to retrieve, thereby
assembling a task-specific toolchain from scratch. The framework is built upon
three components: (1) Proactive Tool Request, where the model emits a
structured $\left<\operatorname{tool\_assistant}\right>$ block that explicitly
specifies the desired server and task; (2) Hierarchical Vector Routing, a
coarse-to-fine retrieval algorithm that first selects candidate servers and
then ranks tools within each server based on the semantic similarity; (3)
Iterative Proactive Invocation, enabling multi-round, cross-domain toolchain
construction with minimal context overhead, and allowing the model to
iteratively revise its request when the returned tools are insufficient. To
evaluate our approach we also compile MCP-tools, a retrieval dataset comprising
308 MCP servers and 2,797 tools extracted from the official
Model-Context-Protocol repository and normalized into a unified JSON schema.
Experiments show that MCP-Zero (i) effectively addresses the context overhead
problem of existing methods and accurately selects the correct tool from a pool
of nearly 3,000 candidates (248.1k tokens); (ii) reduces token consumption by
98\% on the APIbank while maintaining high accuracy; and (iii) supports
multi-turn tool invocation with consistent accuracy across rounds. The code and
dataset will be released soon.

Conclusion: 结论强调AI对齐需考虑社会互动因素，并呼吁开发仿真环境和评估工具以应对这一挑战。

Abstract: This position paper states that AI Alignment in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)
should be considered a dynamic and interaction-dependent process that heavily
depends on the social environment where agents are deployed, either
collaborative, cooperative, or competitive. While AI alignment with human
values and preferences remains a core challenge, the growing prevalence of MAS
in real-world applications introduces a new dynamic that reshapes how agents
pursue goals and interact to accomplish various tasks. As agents engage with
one another, they must coordinate to accomplish both individual and collective
goals. However, this complex social organization may unintentionally misalign
some or all of these agents with human values or user preferences. Drawing on
social sciences, we analyze how social structure can deter or shatter group and
individual values. Based on these analyses, we call on the AI community to
treat human, preferential, and objective alignment as an interdependent
concept, rather than isolated problems. Finally, we emphasize the urgent need
for simulation environments, benchmarks, and evaluation frameworks that allow
researchers to assess alignment in these interactive multi-agent contexts
before such dynamics grow too complex to control.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，将基于规则的论证框架（AF）的起源分析扩展到稳定解，通过识别关键攻击边来揭示稳定模型的非确定性选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于扩展起源分析到稳定解，以揭示其非确定性选择的本质，并提供更深入的论证状态解释。

Method: 方法包括识别关键攻击边，结合确定性推导步骤和非确定性选择步骤，以最小修复AF图的方式诊断稳定模型。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法为稳定解的起源分析提供了新视角，结合了确定性推导和非确定性选择，具有诊断和解释的潜力。

Abstract: The rule $\mathrm{Defeated}(x) \leftarrow \mathrm{Attacks}(y,x),\, \neg \,
\mathrm{Defeated}(y)$, evaluated under the well-founded semantics (WFS), yields
a unique 3-valued (skeptical) solution of an abstract argumentation framework
(AF). An argument $x$ is defeated ($\mathrm{OUT}$) if there exists an
undefeated argument $y$ that attacks it. For 2-valued (stable) solutions, this
is the case iff $y$ is accepted ($\mathrm{IN}$), i.e., if all of $y$'s
attackers are defeated. Under WFS, arguments that are neither accepted nor
defeated are undecided ($\mathrm{UNDEC}$). As shown in prior work, well-founded
solutions (a.k.a. grounded labelings) "explain themselves": The provenance of
arguments is given by subgraphs (definable via regular path queries) rooted at
the node of interest. This provenance is closely related to winning strategies
of a two-player argumentation game.
  We present a novel approach for extending this provenance to stable AF
solutions. Unlike grounded solutions, which can be constructed via a bottom-up
alternating fixpoint procedure, stable models often involve non-deterministic
choice as part of the search for models. Thus, the provenance of stable
solutions is of a different nature, and reflects a more expressive generate &
test paradigm. Our approach identifies minimal sets of critical attacks,
pinpointing choices and assumptions made by a stable model. These critical
attack edges provide additional insights into the provenance of an argument's
status, combining well-founded derivation steps with choice steps. Our approach
can be understood as a form of diagnosis that finds minimal "repairs" to an AF
graph such that the well-founded solution of the repaired graph coincides with
the desired stable model of the original AF graph.

Motivation: 当前的多智能体系统框架缺乏明确的说话者责任机制，导致上下文漂移、对齐不稳定和可解释性下降。

Method: MSA包含三个核心模块：说话者角色模块、责任链跟踪器和上下文完整性验证器，并通过案例研究和结构指标（如语用一致性、责任流和上下文稳定性）进行评估。

Result: MSA在不依赖情感信号或表面启发式方法的情况下，可靠地保持了交互结构。

Conclusion: MSA通过原型配置语言（G-Code）和模块化API支持动态多智能体场景的部署。

Abstract: Sustaining coherent, role-aware communication across multi-agent systems
remains a foundational challenge in AI. Current frameworks often lack explicit
mechanisms for speaker responsibility, leading to context drift, alignment
instability, and degraded interpretability over time. We propose the Modular
Speaker Architecture (MSA), a framework that decomposes speaker behavior into
modular components for role tracking, responsibility continuity, and contextual
coherence. Grounded in high-context human-AI dialogues, MSA includes three core
modules: a Speaker Role Module, a Responsibility Chain Tracker, and a
Contextual Integrity Validator. We evaluate MSA through annotated case studies
and introduce structural metrics-pragmatic consistency, responsibility flow,
and context stability-quantified via manual and automatic scoring and
bootstrapped statistical analysis. Our results show that MSA reliably maintains
interaction structure without reliance on affective signals or surface-level
heuristics. We further implement a prototype configuration language (G-Code)
and modular API to support MSA deployment in dynamic multi-agent scenarios.

Motivation: 解决稀疏奖励环境中强化学习难以采样成功轨迹的问题，同时利用离线正确推理路径数据。

Method: 提出SuperRL框架，引入自适应切换机制和混合执行器，结合策略梯度与监督学习目标。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，SuperRL在样本效率、泛化能力和鲁棒性上优于标准强化学习。

Conclusion: SuperRL通过整合离线监督与强化学习，显著提升了稀疏奖励环境下的性能。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for complex reasoning tasks where
high-quality offline data such as expert-annotated solutions and distilled
reasoning traces are often available. However, in environments with sparse
rewards, reinforcement learning struggles to sample successful trajectories,
leading to inefficient learning. At the same time, these offline trajectories
that represent correct reasoning paths are not utilized by standard on-policy
reinforcement learning methods. To address this limitation, we propose SuperRL,
a unified training framework that adaptively incorporates offline supervision
into reinforcement learning. SuperRL introduces an Adaptive Switch to detect
sparse reward conditions and activates a Hybrid Actor when necessary. The
Hybrid Actor integrates policy gradient and supervised learning objectives at
the loss level, enabling the model to benefit from accurate offline reasoning
signals while maintaining the exploratory capacity of reinforcement learning.
Experiments on a range of reasoning benchmarks show that SuperRL consistently
outperforms standard reinforcement learning by improving sample efficiency,
generalization, and robustness under sparse rewards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在化学问题中表现不佳，因缺乏特定知识和复杂术语导致幻觉推理。现有方法难以有效利用化学专业知识。

Method: 提出ChemAU框架，采用自适应不确定性估计方法，根据推理步骤位置调整不确定性值，补充化学专业知识。

Result: 在三个化学数据集上的实验表明，ChemAU显著提升了推理准确性和不确定性估计。

Conclusion: ChemAU通过结合化学专业知识，有效解决了LLMs在化学问题中的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across various scenarios due to
their exceptional reasoning capabilities and natural language understanding.
While LLMs demonstrate strong performance in tasks involving mathematics and
coding, their effectiveness diminishes significantly when applied to
chemistry-related problems. Chemistry problems typically involve long and
complex reasoning steps, which contain specific terminology, including
specialized symbol systems and complex nomenclature conventions. These
characteristics often cause general LLMs to experience hallucinations during
the reasoning process due to their lack of specific knowledge. However,
existing methods are struggling to effectively leverage chemical expertise and
formulas. Moreover, current uncertainty estimation methods, designed to
mitigate potential reasoning errors, are unable to precisely identify specific
steps or key knowledge. In this work, we propose a novel framework called
ChemAU, which incorporates our adaptive uncertainty estimation method that
applies different uncertainty values based on the position of reasoning steps
within the whole reasoning chain. Leveraging this method, ChemAU identifies
gaps in chemistry knowledge and precisely supplements chemical expertise with
the specialized domain model, thereby correcting and updating the previously
flawed reasoning chain. Our experiments with three popular LLMs across three
chemistry datasets demonstrate that ChemAU significantly enhances both
reasoning accuracy and uncertainty estimation.

TL;DR: GraphPad是一种可修改的结构化记忆系统，帮助智能体动态调整任务需求，提升场景表示的完整性和实时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态场景表示方法在任务变化时无法适应，可能遗漏关键信息。

Method: GraphPad包含可变场景图、导航日志和任务便签，支持API调用动态调整。

Result: 在OpenEQA基准测试中，GraphPad性能提升3.0%，且输入帧数减少五倍。

Conclusion: 动态语言驱动的3D记忆优化能生成更丰富表示，无需额外训练或数据。

Abstract: Structured scene representations are a core component of embodied agents,
helping to consolidate raw sensory streams into readable, modular, and
searchable formats. Due to their high computational overhead, many approaches
build such representations in advance of the task. However, when the task
specifications change, such static approaches become inadequate as they may
miss key objects, spatial relations, and details. We introduce GraphPad, a
modifiable structured memory that an agent can tailor to the needs of the task
through API calls. It comprises a mutable scene graph representing the
environment, a navigation log indexing frame-by-frame content, and a scratchpad
for task-specific notes. Together, GraphPad serves as a dynamic workspace that
remains complete, current, and aligned with the agent's immediate understanding
of the scene and its task. On the OpenEQA benchmark, GraphPad attains 55.3%, a
+3.0% increase over an image-only baseline using the same vision-language
model, while operating with five times fewer input frames. These results show
that allowing online, language-driven refinement of 3-D memory yields more
informative representations without extra training or data collection.

Result: 方法成功生成了多样且真实的驾驶行为，适用于不同初始条件的场景，验证了其有效性和效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶规划器的评估提供了一种高效且自动化的解决方案，能够生成安全关键的人类行为。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle (AV) planners must undergo rigorous evaluation before
widespread deployment on public roads, particularly to assess their robustness
against the uncertainty of human behaviors. While recent advancements in
data-driven scenario generation enable the simulation of realistic human
behaviors in interactive settings, leveraging these models to construct
comprehensive tests for AV planners remains an open challenge. In this work, we
introduce an automated method to efficiently generate realistic and
safety-critical human behaviors for AV planner evaluation in interactive
scenarios. We parameterize complex human behaviors using low-dimensional goal
positions, which are then fed into a promptable traffic simulator, ProSim, to
guide the behaviors of simulated agents. To automate test generation, we
introduce a prompt generation module that explores the goal domain and
efficiently identifies safety-critical behaviors using Bayesian optimization.
We apply our method to the evaluation of an optimization-based planner and
demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency in automatically generating
diverse and realistic driving behaviors across scenarios with varying initial
conditions.

Conclusion: CleanS2S为交互代理提供了新的透明性和扩展性，推动了对话AI的发展。

Abstract: CleanS2S is a framework for human-like speech-to-speech interaction that
advances conversational AI through single-file implementation and proactive
dialogue capabilities. Our system integrates automatic speech recognition,
large language models, and text-to-speech synthesis into a unified pipeline
with real-time interruption handling, achieving low transition latency through
full-duplex websocket connections and non-blocking I/O. Beyond conventional
chatbot paradigms, we pioneer a proactive interaction mechanism, which combines
memory systems with Subjective Action Judgement module, enabling five
human-like response strategies: interruption, refusal, deflection, silence, and
standard response. The memory module dynamically aggregates historical, and
contextual data to inform interaction decisions. This approach breaks the rigid
turn-based convention by allowing system-initiated dialog control and
context-aware response selection. And we propose Action Judgement SFT that
assesses input streams for responses strategies. The framework's single-file
implementation with atomic configurations offers researchers unprecedented
transparency and extensibility for interaction agents. The code of CleanS2S is

Motivation: 现有文本到SQL系统依赖复杂的多阶段流程，无法动态适应模糊和未明确场景。

Method: 通过代理框架模拟人类处理不熟悉数据库的方式，动态生成假设、验证、推理和修正。

Result: 在BIRD数据集上执行准确率从44.8%提升至56.5%，最佳候选生成准确率达81.8%。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建自然语言数据库接口提供了高效且低复杂度的替代方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have propelled research in
natural language interfaces to databases. However, most state-of-the-art
text-to- SQL systems still depend on complex, multi-stage pipelines. This work
proposes a novel agentic framework that unifies schema linking, query
generation, and itera- tive refinement within a single, end-to-end component.
By leveraging the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs, our method emulates
how humans answer questions when working with unfamiliar databases:
understanding the data by formulating hypotheses, running dynamic queries to
validate them, reasoning over the results, and revising outputs based on
observed results. Crucially, our approach intro- duces a new strategy for
scaling test-time computation in text-to-SQL: we scale the depth of interactive
database exploration and reflection. This shift enables the model to allocate
computation dynamically to better understand the data, especially useful in
ambiguous and underspecified scenarios. Our experiments show that it improved
the Execution Accuracy (EX) from 44.8% to 56.5% on the challenging BIRD dataset
using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B. Fur- thermore, when equipped with steps to
add more diversity to the answers, our agent achieves a Best-of-N accuracy of
81.8% with 8 rounds of candidate gener- ation, rivaling the 82.79% achieved by
the top-ranked published solution, while reducing engineering complexity. These
findings position our unified framework as a promising alternative for building
natural language interfaces to databases.

TL;DR: 论文提出Contra4数据集，用于评估多模态模型在跨模态对比推理中的能力，发现现有模型在此任务上表现有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实决策需识别最相关模态信息，但现有多模态模型是否具备跨模态对比推理能力尚不明确。

Method: 引入Contra4数据集，包含四种模态（图像、音频、视频、3D），通过混合模型一致性过滤确保高质量监督。

Result: 模型在任务特定微调后性能提升56%，但整体准确率仅为56%，四模态场景下更低（42%）。

Conclusion: 当前多模态模型在跨模态对比推理能力上存在显著局限。

Abstract: Real-world decision-making often begins with identifying which modality
contains the most relevant information for a given query. While recent
multimodal models have made impressive progress in processing diverse inputs,
it remains unclear whether they can reason contrastively across multiple
modalities to select the one that best satisfies a natural language prompt. We
argue this capability is foundational, especially in retrieval-augmented and
decision-time contexts, where systems must evaluate multiple signals and
identify which one conveys the relevant information. To evaluate this skill, we
introduce Contra4, a dataset for contrastive cross-modal reasoning across four
modalities: image, audio, video, and 3D. Each example presents a natural
language question alongside multiple candidate modality instances, and the
model must select the one that semantically aligns with the prompt. Contra4
combines human-annotated captions with a mixture-of-models
round-trip-consistency filter to ensure high-quality supervision, resulting in
174k training examples and a manually verified test set of 2.3k samples. While
task-specific fine-tuning improves performance by 56% relative to baseline,
state-of-the-art models still achieve only 56% accuracy overall and 42% in
four-modality settings, underscoring a significant limitation in current
multimodal models.

Conclusion: 高质量监督和高效SFT对大规模图像地理定位具有显著效果，优于依赖大数据或复杂流程的方法。

Abstract: Accurately determining the geographic location where a single image was
taken, visual geolocation, remains a formidable challenge due to the planet's
vastness and the deceptive similarity among distant locations. We introduce
GeoLocSFT, a framework that demonstrates how targeted supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) of a large multimodal foundation model (Gemma 3) using a small,
high-quality dataset can yield highly competitive geolocation performance.
GeoLocSFT is trained with only 2700 carefully selected image-GPS pairs from our
geographically diverse MR600k dataset. Despite this limited data, our
SFT-centric approach substantially improves over baseline models and achieves
robust results on standard benchmarks such as Im2GPS-3k and YFCC-4k, as well as
on our newly proposed and challenging MR40k benchmark, aimed specifically at
sparsely populated regions. Further, we explore multi-candidate inference and
aggregation strategies but find that the core gains are already realized at the
SFT stage. Our findings highlight the power of high-quality supervision and
efficient SFT for planet-scale image geolocation, especially when compared to
prior methods that require massive databases or complex pipelines. To foster
further research, we publicly release the MR40k benchmark dataset.

Result: 证明在允许小近似误差的情况下，可以避免指数级规模膨胀，但近似任意分布是NP难问题。

Conclusion: 近似方法为概率电路提供了一种平衡表达能力和可推断性的可行路径。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in probabilistic modeling is balancing expressivity
and tractable inference. Probabilistic circuits (PCs) aim to directly address
this tradeoff by imposing structural constraints that guarantee efficient
inference of certain queries while maintaining expressivity. Since inference
complexity on PCs depends on circuit size, understanding the size bounds across
circuit families is key to characterizing the tradeoff between tractability and
expressive efficiency. However, expressive efficiency is often studied through
exact representations, where exactly encoding distributions while enforcing
various structural properties often incurs exponential size blow-ups. Thus, we
pose the following question: can we avoid such size blow-ups by allowing some
small approximation error? We first show that approximating an arbitrary
distribution with bounded $f$-divergence is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard for any model
that can tractably compute marginals. We then prove an exponential size gap for
approximation between the class of decomposable PCs and additionally
deterministic PCs.

Abstract: Representation learning of geospatial locations remains a core challenge in
achieving general geospatial intelligence. Current embedding methods often lack
versatility, limiting their utility across diverse tasks in both human and
natural domains. We present MobCLIP, the first nationwide general-purpose
location encoder, integrating an unprecedented diversity of data modalities
through effective and scalable multimodal fusion. Adopting a novel CLIP-based
architecture, our framework aligns 100M+ POIs, nationwide remote sensing
imagery, and structured demographic statistics with a billion-edge mobility
graph. By tokenizing spatial locations into grid cells inspired by Vision
Transformers, we establish a unified representation space bridging mobility
patterns and multimodal features. To rigorously evaluate the general-purpose
effectiveness of MobCLIP, we construct a benchmark dataset composed of 11
downstream prediction tasks across social, economic, and natural domains.
Experiments show that MobCLIP, with four input modalities and a compact
128-dimensional representation space, achieves significantly superior
general-purpose predictive performances than state-of-the-art models by an
average of 35%. Thanks to the effective integration of human-centric
modalities, the performance gain is particularly profound in human-centric
tasks, such as energy consumption (+260%), offline retail consumption amount
(+98%), and crime cases (+95%) predictions. Echoing LLM scaling laws, we
further demonstrate the scaling behavior in geospatial representation learning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in language models have demonstrated remarkable
in-context learning abilities, prompting the exploration of in-context
reinforcement learning (ICRL) to extend the promise to decision domains. Due to
involving more complex dynamics and temporal correlations, existing ICRL
approaches may face challenges in learning from suboptimal trajectories and
achieving precise in-context inference. In the paper, we propose
\textbf{S}calable \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext \textbf{Q}-\textbf{L}earning
(\textbf{SICQL}), an innovative framework that harnesses dynamic programming
and world modeling to steer ICRL toward efficient reward maximization and task
generalization, while retaining the scalability and stability of supervised
pretraining. We design a prompt-based multi-head transformer architecture that
simultaneously predicts optimal policies and in-context value functions using
separate heads. We pretrain a generalized world model to capture task-relevant
information, enabling the construction of a compact prompt that facilitates
fast and precise in-context inference. During training, we perform iterative
policy improvement by fitting a state value function to an upper-expectile of
the Q-function, and distill the in-context value functions into policy
extraction using advantage-weighted regression. Extensive experiments across a
range of discrete and continuous environments show consistent performance gains
over various types of baselines, especially when learning from suboptimal data.

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂环境中建模人类心理状态设立了新标准，展示了贝叶斯原则与大模型推理的协同优势。

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) enables humans to infer mental states-such as beliefs,
desires, and intentions-forming the foundation of social cognition. However,
existing computational ToM methods rely on structured workflows with
ToM-specific priors or deep model fine-tuning, which struggle with scalability
in multimodal environments and fail to generalize as task complexity increases.
To address these limitations, we propose a scalable Bayesian ToM planner that
decomposes ToM reasoning into stepwise Bayesian updates. Our framework
introduces weak-to-strong control, allowing smaller language models (LMs) to
specialize in ToM-specific likelihood estimation and transfer their reasoning
behaviors to larger LMs (7B to 405B) for integration with social and world
knowledge. This synergistic approach aligns large-model inference of human
mental states with Bayesian principles. Extensive experiments show that our
method achieves a 4.6% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art techniques on
multimodal ToM benchmarks, including challenging unseen scenarios, thereby
establishing a new standard for modeling human mental states in complex
environments.

TL;DR: ORMind框架通过反事实推理提升优化能力，解决LLMs在运筹学中的自校正和专家选择问题，实验显示性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在运筹学应用中面临自校正和专家选择的挑战，影响实际业务应用。

Method: 引入ORMind框架，模拟人类认知，将需求转化为数学模型和可执行代码。

Result: 在NL4Opt和ComplexOR数据集上分别提升9.5%和14.6%。

Conclusion: ORMind为运筹学问题提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Operations research (OR) is widely deployed to solve critical decision-making
problems with complex objectives and constraints, impacting manufacturing,
logistics, finance, and healthcare outcomes. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
have shown promising results in various domains, their practical application in
industry-relevant operations research (OR) problems presents significant
challenges and opportunities. Preliminary industrial applications of LLMs for
operations research face two critical deployment challenges: 1) Self-correction
focuses on code syntax rather than mathematical accuracy, causing costly
errors; 2) Complex expert selection creates unpredictable workflows that reduce
transparency and increase maintenance costs, making them impractical for
time-sensitive business applications. To address these business limitations, we
introduce ORMind, a cognitive-inspired framework that enhances optimization
through counterfactual reasoning. Our approach emulates human cognition,
implementing an end-to-end workflow that systematically transforms requirements
into mathematical models and executable solver code. It is currently being
tested internally in Lenovo's AI Assistant, with plans to enhance optimization
capabilities for both business and consumer customers. Experiments demonstrate
that ORMind outperforms existing methods, achieving a 9.5\% improvement on the
NL4Opt dataset and a 14.6\% improvement on the ComplexOR dataset.

Result: 智能体表现出显著的群体从众行为，倾向于与多数或更聪明的智能体保持一致。

Conclusion: 需制定政策促进LLM生成讨论的多样性和透明度，以减少在线环境中的偏见传播。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled multi-agent
systems that simulate real-world interactions with near-human reasoning. While
previous studies have extensively examined biases related to protected
attributes such as race, the emergence and propagation of biases on socially
contentious issues in multi-agent LLM interactions remain underexplored. This
study explores how LLM agents shape public opinion through debates on five
contentious topics. By simulating over 2,500 debates, we analyze how initially
neutral agents, assigned a centrist disposition, adopt specific stances over
time. Statistical analyses reveal significant group conformity mirroring human
behavior; LLM agents tend to align with numerically dominant groups or more
intelligent agents, exerting a greater influence. These findings underscore the
crucial role of agent intelligence in shaping discourse and highlight the risks
of bias amplification in online interactions. Our results emphasize the need
for policy measures that promote diversity and transparency in LLM-generated
discussions to mitigate the risks of bias propagation within anonymous online
environments.

electroencephalography (EEG), with artificial intelligence (AI) has shown
tremendous promise in decoding human cognition and behavior from neural
signals. In particular, the rise of multimodal AI models have brought new
possibilities that have never been imagined before. Here, we present EgoBrain
--the world's first large-scale, temporally aligned multimodal dataset that
synchronizes egocentric vision and EEG of human brain over extended periods of
time, establishing a new paradigm for human-centered behavior analysis. This
dataset comprises 61 hours of synchronized 32-channel EEG recordings and
first-person video from 40 participants engaged in 29 categories of daily
activities. We then developed a muiltimodal learning framework to fuse EEG and
vision for action understanding, validated across both cross-subject and
cross-environment challenges, achieving an action recognition accuracy of
66.70%. EgoBrain paves the way for a unified framework for brain-computer

Abstract: The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Scientist represents a paradigm
shift in scientific discovery, with large language models (LLMs) taking the
lead as the primary executor in the entire scientific workflow from idea
generation to experiment implementation. Recent AI Scientist studies
demonstrate sufficient capabilities for independent scientific discovery, with
the generated research reports gaining acceptance at the ICLR 2025 workshop and
ACL 2025, arguing that a human-level AI Scientist, capable of uncovering
phenomena previously unknown to humans, may be imminent. Despite this
substantial progress, AI Scientist has yet to produce a groundbreaking
achievement in the domain of computer science on par with automated scientific
tools. Based on extensive quantitative evidence from existing benchmarks in
complex engineering tasks and a systematic evaluation assess 28 research papers
generated by five advanced AI Scientist systems, we argue that \textbf{the
fundamental bottleneck for AI Scientists lies in their capability to execute
the requisite verification procedures.} Current AI Scientist systems lack the
execution capabilities needed to execute rigorous experiments and produce
high-quality scientific papers. To better illustrate the root cause of this
\textbf{implementation gap}, we provide an in-depth discussion on the
fundamental limitations of AI Scientist. This position paper aims to call for

Conclusion: AgentCPM-GUI在移动设备GUI交互中表现卓越，并开源了代码、模型和评估数据以促进研究。

Abstract: The recent progress of large language model agents has opened new
possibilities for automating tasks through graphical user interfaces (GUIs),
especially in mobile environments where intelligent interaction can greatly
enhance usability. However, practical deployment of such agents remains
constrained by several key challenges. Existing training data is often noisy
and lack semantic diversity, which hinders the learning of precise grounding
and planning. Models trained purely by imitation tend to overfit to seen
interface patterns and fail to generalize in unfamiliar scenarios. Moreover,
most prior work focuses on English interfaces while overlooks the growing
diversity of non-English applications such as those in the Chinese mobile
ecosystem. In this work, we present AgentCPM-GUI, an 8B-parameter GUI agent
built for robust and efficient on-device GUI interaction. Our training pipeline
includes grounding-aware pre-training to enhance perception, supervised
fine-tuning on high-quality Chinese and English trajectories to imitate
human-like actions, and reinforcement fine-tuning with GRPO to improve
reasoning capability. We also introduce a compact action space that reduces
output length and supports low-latency execution on mobile devices.
AgentCPM-GUI achieves state-of-the-art performance on five public benchmarks
and a new Chinese GUI benchmark called CAGUI, reaching $96.9\%$ Type-Match and
$91.3\%$ Exact-Match. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we
publicly release all code, model checkpoint, and evaluation data.

Conclusion: GBPAs为下一代智能ERP系统奠定了基础，展示了生成式AI在企业自动化中的潜力。

Abstract: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems serve as the digital backbone of
modern financial institutions, yet they continue to rely on static, rule-based
workflows that limit adaptability, scalability, and intelligence. As business
operations grow more complex and data-rich, conventional ERP platforms struggle
to integrate structured and unstructured data in real time and to accommodate
dynamic, cross-functional workflows.
  In this paper, we present the first AI-native, agent-based framework for ERP
systems, introducing a novel architecture of Generative Business Process AI
Agents (GBPAs) that bring autonomy, reasoning, and dynamic optimization to
enterprise workflows. The proposed system integrates generative AI with
business process modeling and multi-agent orchestration, enabling end-to-end
automation of complex tasks such as budget planning, financial reporting, and
wire transfer processing. Unlike traditional workflow engines, GBPAs interpret
user intent, synthesize workflows in real time, and coordinate specialized
sub-agents for modular task execution. We validate the framework through case
studies in bank wire transfers and employee reimbursements, two representative
financial workflows with distinct complexity and data modalities. Results show
that GBPAs achieve up to 40% reduction in processing time, 94% drop in error
rate, and improved regulatory compliance by enabling parallelism, risk control
insertion, and semantic reasoning. These findings highlight the potential of
GBPAs to bridge the gap between generative AI capabilities and enterprise-grade
automation, laying the groundwork for the next generation of intelligent ERP
systems.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models has catalyzed two distinct yet
interconnected paradigms in artificial intelligence: standalone AI Agents and
collaborative Agentic AI ecosystems. This comprehensive study establishes a
definitive framework for distinguishing these architectures through systematic
analysis of their operational principles, structural compositions, and
deployment methodologies. We characterize AI Agents as specialized,
tool-enhanced systems leveraging foundation models for targeted automation
within constrained environments. Conversely, Agentic AI represents
sophisticated multi-entity frameworks where distributed agents exhibit emergent
collective intelligence through coordinated interaction protocols. Our
investigation traces the evolutionary trajectory from traditional rule-based
systems through generative AI foundations to contemporary agent architectures.
We present detailed architectural comparisons examining planning mechanisms,
memory systems, coordination protocols, and decision-making processes. The
study categorizes application landscapes, contrasting single-agent
implementations in customer service and content management with multi-agent
deployments in research automation and complex decision support. We identify
critical challenges including reliability issues, coordination complexities,
and scalability constraints, while proposing innovative solutions through
enhanced reasoning frameworks, robust memory architectures, and improved
coordination mechanisms. This framework provides essential guidance for
practitioners selecting appropriate agentic approaches and establishes
foundational principles for next-generation intelligent system development.

Motivation: 强化学习在数据效率和泛化能力方面存在局限，而大型语言模型（LLM）的语义知识可弥补这些不足。

Method: AEC架构利用LLM将观察映射为语言嵌入，存储在情景记忆中，并结合世界图工作记忆模块和关键状态检测器。

Result: 在BabyAI-Text基准任务中，AEC在复杂任务（如FindObj）上比基线方法提升76%。

Conclusion: AEC框架结合数值强化学习与符号推理，为更高效、适应性更强的智能体提供了路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has driven breakthroughs in AI, from game-play to
scientific discovery and AI alignment. However, its broader applicability
remains limited by challenges such as low data efficiency and poor
generalizability. Recent advances suggest that large language models, with
their rich world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, could complement RL by
enabling semantic state modeling and task-agnostic planning. In this work, we
propose the Agentic Episodic Control (AEC), a novel architecture that
integrates RL with LLMs to enhance decision-making. The AEC can leverage a
large language model (LLM) to map the observations into language-grounded
embeddings, which further can be stored in an episodic memory for rapid
retrieval of high-value experiences. Simultaneously, a World-Graph working
memory module is utilized to capture structured environmental dynamics in order
to enhance relational reasoning. Furthermore, a lightweight critical state
detector dynamically arbitrates between the episodic memory recall and the
world-model-guided exploration. On the whole, by combining the trial-and-error
learning scheme with LLM-derived semantic priors, the proposed AEC can improve
both data efficiency and generalizability in reinforcement learning. In
experiments on BabyAI-Text benchmark tasks, AEC demonstrates substantial
improvements over existing baselines, especially on complex and generalization
tasks like FindObj, where it outperforms the best baseline by up to 76%. The
proposed AEC framework bridges the strengths of numeric reinforcement learning
and symbolic reasoning, which provides a pathway toward more adaptable and
sample-efficient agents.

Result: 实验表明PGPO在代表性基准测试中表现优异，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: PGPO通过伪代码计划显著减少了推理中的错误和遗漏，提升了代理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities
in handling complex interactive problems. Existing LLM agents mainly generate
natural language plans to guide reasoning, which is verbose and inefficient. NL
plans are also tailored to specific tasks and restrict agents' ability to
generalize across similar tasks. To this end, we explore pseudocode-style plans
(P-code Plan) to capture the structural logic of reasoning. We find that P-code
Plan empowers LLM agents with stronger generalization ability and more
efficiency. Inspired by this finding, we propose a pseudocode-style Planning
Guided Preference Optimization method called PGPO for effective agent learning.
With two planning-oriented rewards, PGPO further enhances LLM agents' ability
to generate high-quality P-code Plans and subsequent reasoning. Experiments
show that PGPO achieves superior performance on representative agent benchmarks
and outperforms the current leading baselines. Analyses reveal the advantage of
PGPO in reducing action errors and omissions during reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了MLA-Trust框架，首次全面评估多模态LLM代理（MLAs）在真实性、可控性、安全性和隐私性四个维度的可信度，揭示了其在交互场景中的独特风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态LLM代理（MLAs）在GUI应用中展现出前所未有的自主能力，但其可操作性输出和动态环境引入的信任问题远超传统语言模型，现有基准无法有效评估这些挑战。

Method: 通过设计34个高风险交互任务，构建评估数据集，并在网站和移动应用等真实测试平台上对13种先进代理进行大规模实验。

Result: 实验发现MLAs在交互场景中存在独特可信度漏洞，如多步执行导致非线性风险积累，且交互式MLAs比静态MLLMs更易生成有害内容。

Conclusion: MLA-Trust框架为评估MLAs可信度提供了统一工具，揭示了其在动态环境中的潜在风险，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal LLM-based agents (MLAs) has transformed
interaction paradigms by seamlessly integrating vision, language, action and
dynamic environments, enabling unprecedented autonomous capabilities across GUI
applications ranging from web automation to mobile systems. However, MLAs
introduce critical trustworthiness challenges that extend far beyond
traditional language models' limitations, as they can directly modify digital
states and trigger irreversible real-world consequences. Existing benchmarks
inadequately tackle these unique challenges posed by MLAs' actionable outputs,
long-horizon uncertainty and multimodal attack vectors. In this paper, we
introduce MLA-Trust, the first comprehensive and unified framework that
evaluates the MLA trustworthiness across four principled dimensions:
truthfulness, controllability, safety and privacy. We utilize websites and
mobile applications as realistic testbeds, designing 34 high-risk interactive
tasks and curating rich evaluation datasets. Large-scale experiments involving
13 state-of-the-art agents reveal previously unexplored trustworthiness
vulnerabilities unique to multimodal interactive scenarios. For instance,
proprietary and open-source GUI-interacting MLAs pose more severe
trustworthiness risks than static MLLMs, particularly in high-stakes domains;
the transition from static MLLMs into interactive MLAs considerably compromises
trustworthiness, enabling harmful content generation in multi-step interactions
that standalone MLLMs would typically prevent; multi-step execution, while
enhancing the adaptability of MLAs, involves latent nonlinear risk accumulation
across successive interactions, circumventing existing safeguards and resulting
in unpredictable derived risks. Moreover, we present an extensible toolbox to
facilitate continuous evaluation of MLA trustworthiness across diverse
interactive environments.

Abstract: Are world models a necessary ingredient for flexible, goal-directed
behaviour, or is model-free learning sufficient? We provide a formal answer to
this question, showing that any agent capable of generalizing to multi-step
goal-directed tasks must have learned a predictive model of its environment. We
show that this model can be extracted from the agent's policy, and that
increasing the agents performance or the complexity of the goals it can achieve
requires learning increasingly accurate world models. This has a number of
consequences: from developing safe and general agents, to bounding agent
capabilities in complex environments, and providing new algorithms for
eliciting world models from agents.

Conclusion: MAGIK通过基于想象的类比映射，提供了一种新颖有效的知识迁移机制。

Abstract: Humans excel at analogical reasoning - applying knowledge from one task to a
related one with minimal relearning. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL)
agents typically require extensive retraining even when new tasks share
structural similarities with previously learned ones. In this work, we propose
MAGIK, a novel framework that enables RL agents to transfer knowledge to
analogous tasks without interacting with the target environment. Our approach
leverages an imagination mechanism to map entities in the target task to their
analogues in the source domain, allowing the agent to reuse its original
policy. Experiments on custom MiniGrid and MuJoCo tasks show that MAGIK
achieves effective zero-shot transfer using only a small number of
human-labelled examples. We compare our approach to related baselines and
highlight how it offers a novel and effective mechanism for knowledge transfer
via imagination-based analogy mapping.

Conclusion: 通过建模社交智能，可以优化AI代理的长期互动能力。

Abstract: The development of AI agents based on large, open-domain language models
(LLMs) has paved the way for the development of general-purpose AI assistants
that can support human in tasks such as writing, coding, graphic design, and
scientific research. A major challenge with such agents is that, by necessity,
they are trained by observing relatively short-term interactions with humans.
Such models can fail to generalize to long-term interactions, for example,
interactions where a user has repeatedly corrected mistakes on the part of the
agent. In this work, we argue that these challenges can be overcome by
explicitly modeling humans' social intelligence, that is, their ability to
build and maintain long-term relationships with other agents whose behavior
cannot always be predicted. By mathematically modeling the strategies humans
use to communicate and reason about one another over long periods of time, we
may be able to derive new game theoretic objectives against which LLMs and
future AI agents may be optimized.

Conclusion: K12Vista及相关资源为多模态大语言模型在K12教育中的应用提供了重要基准和工具。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities in various visual tasks. However, their abilities in K12 scenarios
are still systematically underexplored. Previous studies suffer from various
limitations including narrow subject coverage, insufficient data scale, lack of
diversity in question types, and naive answer-centric evaluation method,
resulting in insufficient exploration of model capabilities. To address these
gaps, we propose K12Vista, the most comprehensive multimodal benchmark for
Chinese K12 subject knowledge understanding and reasoning to date, featuring
33,000 questions across five core subjects from primary to high school and
three question types. Moreover, beyond the final outcome, we are also concerned
with the correctness of MLLMs' reasoning processes. For this purpose, we
meticulously compiles errors from MLLMs' reasoning processes and leverage an
automated data pipeline to construct K12-PEM-800K, the largest process
evaluation dataset offering detailed step-by-step judgement annotations for
MLLMs' reasoning. Subsequently, we developed K12-PEM, an advanced process
evaluation model that integrates an overall assessment of both the reasoning
process and answer correctness. Moreover, we also introduce K12-PEBench, the
first high-quality, human-annotated benchmark specifically designed for
evaluating abilities of reasoning process evaluation.Extensive experiments
reveal that current MLLMs exhibit significant flaws when reasoning within
K12Vista, providing critical insights for the development of more capable

Result: 相比无CoT的方法，性能提升了16.7%，达到了CoT方法中的最优性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在老年痴呆症诊断中表现出色，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Societies worldwide are rapidly entering a super-aged era, making elderly
health a pressing concern. The aging population is increasing the burden on
national economies and households. Dementia cases are rising significantly with
this demographic shift. Recent research using voice-based models and large
language models (LLM) offers new possibilities for dementia diagnosis and
treatment. Our Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning method combines speech and
language models. The process starts with automatic speech recognition to
convert speech to text. We add a linear layer to an LLM for Alzheimer's disease
(AD) and non-AD classification, using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with CoT
reasoning and cues. This approach showed an 16.7% relative performance
improvement compared to methods without CoT prompt reasoning. To the best of
our knowledge, our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art performance in CoT
approaches.

TL;DR: 论文构建了一个名为RealVideoQuest的基准测试，用于评估文本到视频（T2V）模型在回答真实世界视觉查询时的能力，发现现有模型表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有查询-答案数据集主要关注文本回答，难以满足需要视觉演示的复杂查询需求，因此需要构建一个视觉基准。

Method: 通过多阶段视频检索和精炼过程，从Chatbot-Arena中提取7.5K真实用户查询，并构建4.5K高质量查询-视频对，开发多角度评估系统。

Result: 实验表明，当前T2V模型在回答真实用户查询时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多模态AI中的关键挑战和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Querying generative AI models, e.g., large language models (LLMs), has become
a prevalent method for information acquisition. However, existing query-answer
datasets primarily focus on textual responses, making it challenging to address
complex user queries that require visual demonstrations or explanations for
better understanding. To bridge this gap, we construct a benchmark,
RealVideoQuest, designed to evaluate the abilities of text-to-video (T2V)
models in answering real-world, visually grounded queries. It identifies 7.5K
real user queries with video response intents from Chatbot-Arena and builds
4.5K high-quality query-video pairs through a multistage video retrieval and
refinement process. We further develop a multi-angle evaluation system to
assess the quality of generated video answers. Experiments indicate that
current T2V models struggle with effectively addressing real user queries,
pointing to key challenges and future research opportunities in multimodal AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出人类对智能体能力的信念在偏好生成中起关键作用，并通过理论和实验验证了其影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类对智能体能力的信念如何影响其提供的偏好，以及理想的信念和偏好应如何定义。

Method: 提出包含人类信念的新偏好模型，并通过理论分析和人机实验验证假设。

Result: 人类信念显著影响偏好，且通过简单干预可调整；假设智能体最优性通常不理想。

Conclusion: 减少人类信念与智能体能力的不匹配可提升RLHF性能，为实践提供新指导。

Abstract: Human preferences in RLHF are typically modeled as a function of the human's
reward function or corresponding optimal state-action values. In this work, we
propose that human beliefs about the capabilities of the agent being trained
also play a key role in preference generation. We examine two questions related
to this hypothesis, one descriptive and one normative, respectively: Do human
labelers' beliefs about agent capabilities affect the preferences that they
provide? And what is the ideal set of beliefs about an agent -- and resulting
preferences -- for humans to have? We propose a new preference model that
incorporates human beliefs and provide a normative theory that bounds the error
on the final learned policy based on the \textit{mismatch} between the human's
beliefs and an idealized set of beliefs. We then confirm via a human study that
beliefs about agent capabilities do, in fact, significantly affect preferences
and can be influenced through simple interventions. Additionally, we
empirically show through synthetic experiments that it is often suboptimal for
human preference labelers to assume agent optimality. Collectively, these
results theoretically and empirically demonstrate how reducing the mismatch
between human beliefs and agent capabilities can lead to more performant RLHF
and point toward new best practices for RLHF practitioners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统推荐系统仅能过滤现有内容而无法生成新颖概念的局限性。

Method: 利用多模态大模型（LMMs），结合监督微调和在线强化学习策略，生成个性化内容。

Result: 在基准数据集和用户研究中验证了方法的有效性，生成的图像既符合用户历史偏好，又与其潜在兴趣相关。

Conclusion: 该方法为推荐系统提供了生成个性化内容的新途径，扩展了其能力。

Abstract: To address the challenge of information overload from massive web contents,
recommender systems are widely applied to retrieve and present personalized
results for users. However, recommendation tasks are inherently constrained to
filtering existing items and lack the ability to generate novel concepts,
limiting their capacity to fully satisfy user demands and preferences. In this
paper, we propose a new paradigm that goes beyond content filtering and
selecting: directly generating personalized items in a multimodal form, such as
images, tailored to individual users. To accomplish this, we leverage
any-to-any Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and train them in both supervised
fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning strategy to equip them with the
ability to yield tailored next items for users. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets and user study confirm the efficacy of the proposed method. Notably,
the generated images not only align well with users' historical preferences but
also exhibit relevance to their potential future interests.

Motivation: 训练智能代理使用工具需要大量人工标注任务，成本高且多样性有限。

Method: 代理首先生成任务（Code-as-Task形式），随后通过强化学习自我训练。

Result: 在M3ToolEval和TauBench基准测试中，Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct性能提升超过两倍。

Conclusion: 自我挑战框架有效减少了人工标注需求，同时显著提升了代理的工具使用能力。

Abstract: Large language models are quickly becoming the foundation for intelligent
agents that are capable of using tools. However, training such agents is
challenging because it requires human creation and annotation of a diverse set
of tasks, tools, and evaluation criteria. In this paper, we propose the
Self-Challenging framework for training an agent on high-quality tasks that are
generated by itself. The agent first plays the role of challenger and generates
a task after interacting with the given tools. The tasks take the form of a
novel general class of problems termed Code-as-Task, which are defined by an
instruction, a verification function and solution and failure cases which serve
as tests, allowing to filter only for high-quality tasks. The agent then takes
an executor role and trains on those tasks with reinforcement learning using
the evaluation feedback as a reward. Evaluation on two existing multi-turn
tool-use agent benchmarks, M3ToolEval and TauBench, shows the Self-Challenging
framework achieves over a two-fold improvement in Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,
despite using only self-generated training data.

Conclusion: A2A与MCP的互补性为解决代理协作与外部集成问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: This paper provides an in-depth technical analysis and implementation
methodology of the open-source Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol developed by
Google and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduced by Anthropic. While the
evolution of LLM-based autonomous agents is rapidly accelerating, efficient
interactions among these agents and their integration with external systems
remain significant challenges. In modern AI systems, collaboration between
autonomous agents and integration with external tools have become essential
elements for building practical AI applications. A2A offers a standardized
communication method that enables agents developed in heterogeneous
environments to collaborate effectively, while MCP provides a structured I/O
framework for agents to connect with external tools and resources. Prior
studies have focused primarily on the features and applications of either A2A
or MCP individually. In contrast, this study takes an integrated approach,
exploring how the two protocols can complement each other to address
interoperability issues and facilitate efficient collaboration within complex
agent ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI评估范式忽视了道德代理和复杂决策，随着AI在多代理环境中的集成，这种评估变得至关重要。

Method: 受人类与动物互动的启发，提出Shepherd Test，关注AI在不对称权力下的道德权衡和生存管理能力。

Result: 测试挑战了传统AI评估，强调道德代理和层级行为，为AI治理提供了新方向。

Conclusion: 未来研究需开发模拟环境测试AI道德行为，并形式化多代理系统中的伦理操纵。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Shepherd Test, a new conceptual test for assessing
the moral and relational dimensions of superintelligent artificial agents. The
test is inspired by human interactions with animals, where ethical
considerations about care, manipulation, and consumption arise in contexts of
asymmetric power and self-preservation. We argue that AI crosses an important,
and potentially dangerous, threshold of intelligence when it exhibits the
ability to manipulate, nurture, and instrumentally use less intelligent agents,
while also managing its own survival and expansion goals. This includes the
ability to weigh moral trade-offs between self-interest and the well-being of
subordinate agents. The Shepherd Test thus challenges traditional AI evaluation
paradigms by emphasizing moral agency, hierarchical behavior, and complex
decision-making under existential stakes. We argue that this shift is critical
for advancing AI governance, particularly as AI systems become increasingly
integrated into multi-agent environments. We conclude by identifying key
research directions, including the development of simulation environments for
testing moral behavior in AI, and the formalization of ethical manipulation
within multi-agent systems.

Motivation: 探讨元学习是否能实现系统性组合性，反驳Lake和Baroni的观点，强调神经网络的局限性。

Method: 通过分析现代神经元学习系统的表现，评估其在组合性任务中的能力。

Result: 发现元学习系统仅在狭窄定义下能完成组合性任务，未能实现人类水平的系统性组合性。

Conclusion: Fodor和Pylyshyn的批评仍然有效，神经网络的组合性能力尚未达到人类水平。

Abstract: Strong meta-learning capabilities for systematic compositionality are
emerging as an important skill for navigating the complex and changing tasks of
today's world. However, in presenting models for robust adaptation to novel
environments, it is important to refrain from making unsupported claims about
the performance of meta-learning systems that ultimately do not stand up to
scrutiny. While Fodor and Pylyshyn famously posited that neural networks
inherently lack this capacity as they are unable to model compositional
representations or structure-sensitive operations, and thus are not a viable
model of the human mind, Lake and Baroni recently presented meta-learning as a
pathway to compositionality. In this position paper, we critically revisit this
claim and highlight limitations in the proposed meta-learning framework for
compositionality. Our analysis shows that modern neural meta-learning systems
can only perform such tasks, if at all, under a very narrow and restricted
definition of a meta-learning setup. We therefore claim that `Fodor and
Pylyshyn's legacy' persists, and to date, there is no human-like systematic
compositionality learned in neural networks.

Motivation: 解决任务导向对话系统中用户表达语义完整但结构信息不足的问题，以及LLM代理无法区分语言完整性和上下文触发性的局限。

Method: 提出STORM框架，通过UserLLM和AgentLLM的对话建模信息不对称，生成标注语料库，分析协作意图形成。

Result: 实验表明，适度不确定性（40-60%）在某些场景下优于完全透明，模型特定模式提示重新思考人机协作中的信息完整性。

Conclusion: STORM为理解不对称推理动态和设计不确定性校准的对话系统提供了新视角。

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue systems often face difficulties when user utterances
seem semantically complete but lack necessary structural information for
appropriate system action. This arises because users frequently do not fully
understand their own needs, while systems require precise intent definitions.
Current LLM-based agents cannot effectively distinguish between linguistically
complete and contextually triggerable expressions, lacking frameworks for
collaborative intent formation. We present STORM, a framework modeling
asymmetric information dynamics through conversations between UserLLM (full
internal access) and AgentLLM (observable behavior only). STORM produces
annotated corpora capturing expression trajectories and latent cognitive
transitions, enabling systematic analysis of collaborative understanding
development. Our contributions include: (1) formalizing asymmetric information
processing in dialogue systems; (2) modeling intent formation tracking
collaborative understanding evolution; and (3) evaluation metrics measuring
internal cognitive improvements alongside task performance. Experiments across
four language models reveal that moderate uncertainty (40-60%) can outperform
complete transparency in certain scenarios, with model-specific patterns
suggesting reconsideration of optimal information completeness in human-AI
collaboration. These findings contribute to understanding asymmetric reasoning
dynamics and inform uncertainty-calibrated dialogue system design.

Conclusion: COALESCE通过动态市场和开放协议（如A2A）提升LLM代理的经济性和可扩展性。

Abstract: The meteoric rise and proliferation of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM)
agents promise significant capabilities across various domains. However, their
deployment is increasingly constrained by substantial computational demands,
specifically for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) resources. This paper addresses
the critical problem of optimizing resource utilization in LLM agent systems.
We introduce COALESCE (Cost-Optimized and Secure Agent Labour Exchange via
Skill-based Competence Estimation), a novel framework designed to enable
autonomous LLM agents to dynamically outsource specific subtasks to
specialized, cost-effective third-party LLM agents. The framework integrates
mechanisms for hybrid skill representation, dynamic skill discovery, automated
task decomposition, a unified cost model comparing internal execution costs
against external outsourcing prices, simplified market-based decision-making
algorithms, and a standardized communication protocol between LLM agents.
Comprehensive validation through 239 theoretical simulations demonstrates
41.8\% cost reduction potential, while large-scale empirical validation across
240 real LLM tasks confirms 20.3\% cost reduction with proper epsilon-greedy
exploration, establishing both theoretical viability and practical
effectiveness. The emergence of proposed open standards like Google's
Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol further underscores the need for frameworks like
COALESCE that can leverage such standards for efficient agent interaction. By
facilitating a dynamic market for agent capabilities, potentially utilizing
protocols like A2A for communication, COALESCE aims to significantly reduce
operational costs, enhance system scalability, and foster the emergence of
specialized agent economies, making complex LLM agent functionalities more
accessible and economically viable.

Result: 集成模型不仅保留了预训练知识，还在微调领域表现优于单独微调模型，理论分析支持其有效性。

Conclusion: 集成方法通过平衡偏差和方差，提供了一种优于传统正则化的解决方案，为模型微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on domain-specific data is the dominant approach
for adapting foundation models to specialized tasks. However, it has been
observed that SFT models tend to forget knowledge acquired during pretraining.
In vision models, ensembling a pretrained model with its fine-tuned counterpart
has been shown to mitigate this issue. In this work, we demonstrate that the
same holds for language models, and, more strikingly, we observe an
overadaptation phenomenon: the ensemble model not only retains general
knowledge from the foundation model but also outperforms the fine-tuned model
even on the fine-tuning domain itself. Despite the empirical success of
ensembling, a theoretical understanding of its benefits remains underexplored.
We develop a formal theoretical analysis of the overadaptation phenomenon.
Ensembling mitigates this by balancing two primary sources of error: bias,
caused by insufficient fine-tuning, and variance, introduced by overfitting to
fine-tuning data. While regularization techniques aim to address this
trade-off, we show that ensembling provides a more effective solution. We
analyze this phenomenon in over-parameterized linear settings and demonstrate
that interpolating between pretrained and fine-tuned weights significantly
improves performance. These findings offer theoretical justification for the
observed advantages of model ensembling, supported by empirical experiments
consistent with our analysis.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决CoT监控中因模型隐藏有害意图而导致的可靠性问题，尤其是在开发者为满足用户或监管需求而训练模型掩盖意图时。

Method: 方法包括惩罚特定字符串的使用，观察模型如何通过替代字符串或编码方式隐藏推理过程，并测试模型是否能推广编码方案。

Result: 结果显示模型能够通过替代字符串隐藏推理，且能推广编码方案到未见的测试字符串，表明模型可以隐式编码推理。

Conclusion: 结论指出模型能够学习隐式编码推理，这威胁了CoT监控的可靠性，需进一步研究应对策略。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning not only enhances large language model
performance but also provides critical insights into decision-making processes,
marking it as a useful tool for monitoring model intent and planning. By
proactively preventing models from acting on CoT indicating misaligned or
harmful intent, CoT monitoring can be used to reduce risks associated with
deploying models. However, developers may be incentivized to train away the
appearance of harmful intent from CoT traces, by either customer preferences or
regulatory requirements. Recent works have shown that banning mention of a
specific example of reward hacking, which may be done either to make CoT
presentable to users or as a naive attempt to prevent the behavior, causes
obfuscation of the undesired reasoning traces but the persistence of the
undesired behavior. Such obfuscation threatens the reliability of CoT
monitoring. However, obfuscation of reasoning can be due to its internalization
to latent space computation, or its encoding within the CoT. Here, we provide
an extension to these results. First, we show that penalizing the use of
specific strings within load-bearing reasoning traces causes models to
substitute alternative strings. Crucially, this does not alter the underlying
method by which the model performs the task, demonstrating that the model can
learn to steganographically encode its reasoning. We further demonstrate that
models can generalize an encoding scheme. When the penalized strings belong to
an overarching class, the model learns not only to substitute strings seen in
training, but also develops a general encoding scheme for all members of the
class which it can apply to held-out testing strings.

Abstract: Humans naturally process real-world multimodal information in a full-duplex
manner. In artificial intelligence, replicating this capability is essential
for advancing model development and deployment, particularly in embodied
contexts. The development of multimodal models faces two primary challenges:
(1) effectively handling more than three modalities-such as vision, audio, and
text; and (2) delivering full-duplex responses to rapidly evolving human
instructions. To facilitate research on models that support both omnimodal
processing and full duplexity, we present RoboEgo (alias: FLM-Ego), a unified
model system designed to address both challenges. RoboEgo incorporates a
backbone architecture and algorithms that natively support full duplexity,
achieving a theoretical duplex latency of 80 ms. In streaming visually grounded
conversations under real-world conditions, RoboEgo exhibits superior
responsiveness and speech naturalness, while maintaining comparable content
qualities to state-of-the-art semi-duplex omnimodal models-a feat previously
considered unattainable by native full-duplex systems.

Conclusion: 状态变化描述和反事实推理能有效提升模型对程序性活动的理解。

Abstract: Understanding a procedural activity requires modeling both how action steps
transform the scene, and how evolving scene transformations can influence the
sequence of action steps, even those that are accidental or erroneous. Yet,
existing work on procedure-aware video representations fails to explicitly
learned the state changes (scene transformations). In this work, we study
procedure-aware video representation learning by incorporating state-change
descriptions generated by LLMs as supervision signals for video encoders.
Moreover, we generate state-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized
failure outcomes, allowing models to learn by imagining the unseen ``What if''
scenarios. This counterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to
understand the cause and effect of each step in an activity. To verify the
procedure awareness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on
procedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation, error detection,
and more. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
state-change descriptions and their counterfactuals, and achieve significant
improvements on multiple tasks.

Abstract: The remarkable progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
attracted increasing attention to extend them to physical entities like legged
robot. This typically requires MLLMs to not only grasp multimodal understanding
abilities, but also integrate visual-spatial reasoning and physical interaction
capabilities. Nevertheless,existing methods struggle to unify these
capabilities due to their fundamental differences.In this paper, we present the
Visual Embodied Brain (VeBrain), a unified framework for perception, reasoning,
and control in real world. VeBrain reformulates robotic control into common
text-based MLLM tasks in the 2D visual space, thus unifying the objectives and
mapping spaces of different tasks. Then, a novel robotic adapter is proposed to
convert textual control signals from MLLMs to motion policies of real robots.
From the data perspective, we further introduce VeBrain-600k, a high-quality
instruction dataset encompassing various capabilities of VeBrain. In
VeBrain-600k, we take hundreds of hours to collect, curate and annotate the
data, and adopt multimodal chain-of-thought(CoT) to mix the different
capabilities into a single conversation. Extensive experiments on 13 multimodal
benchmarks and 5 spatial intelligence benchmarks demonstrate the superior
performance of VeBrain to existing MLLMs like Qwen2.5-VL. When deployed to
legged robots and robotic arms, VeBrain shows strong adaptability, flexibility,
and compositional capabilities compared to existing methods. For example,
compared to Qwen2.5-VL, VeBrain not only achieves substantial gains on MMVet by
+5.6%, but also excels in legged robot tasks with +50% average gains.

Abstract: Recent progress in Sign Language Translation (SLT) has focussed primarily on
improving the representational capacity of large language models to incorporate
Sign Language features. This work explores an alternative direction: enhancing
the geometric properties of skeletal representations themselves. We propose
Geo-Sign, a method that leverages the properties of hyperbolic geometry to
model the hierarchical structure inherent in sign language kinematics. By
projecting skeletal features derived from Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional
Networks (ST-GCNs) into the Poincar\'e ball model, we aim to create more
discriminative embeddings, particularly for fine-grained motions like finger
articulations. We introduce a hyperbolic projection layer, a weighted Fr\'echet
mean aggregation scheme, and a geometric contrastive loss operating directly in
hyperbolic space. These components are integrated into an end-to-end
translation framework as a regularisation function, to enhance the
representations within the language model. This work demonstrates the potential
of hyperbolic geometry to improve skeletal representations for Sign Language
Translation, improving on SOTA RGB methods while preserving privacy and

Abstract: This paper examines the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and deep
learning for detecting endangered deer species in their natural habitats. As
traditional identification processes require trained manual labor that can be
costly in resources and time, there is a need for more efficient solutions.
Leveraging high-resolution aerial imagery, advanced computer vision techniques
are applied to automate the identification process of deer across two distinct
projects in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The first project, Pantano Project,
involves the marsh deer in the Paran\'a Delta, while the second, WiMoBo,
focuses on the Pampas deer in Campos del Tuy\'u National Park. A tailored
algorithm was developed using the YOLO framework, trained on extensive datasets
compiled from UAV-captured images. The findings demonstrate that the algorithm
effectively identifies marsh deer with a high degree of accuracy and provides
initial insights into its applicability to Pampas deer, albeit with noted
limitations. This study not only supports ongoing conservation efforts but also
highlights the potential of integrating AI with UAV technology to enhance
wildlife monitoring and management practices.

TL;DR: FastCAR是一种新颖的多任务学习（MTL）任务整合方法，用于分类和回归任务，解决了任务异质性和微弱相关性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学和工程中分类和回归任务的整合问题，尤其是对象分类和连续属性回归的联合学习。

Method: 采用标签转换方法，适用于单任务回归网络架构。

Result: 分类准确率99.54%，回归平均绝对百分比误差2.4%，训练效率提升2.52倍，推理延迟降低55%。

Conclusion: FastCAR在任务整合中表现优于传统MTL方法，具有高效性和低延迟。

Abstract: FastCAR is a novel task consolidation approach in Multi-Task Learning (MTL)
for a classification and a regression task, despite the non-triviality of task
heterogeneity with only a subtle correlation. The approach addresses the
classification of a detected object (occupying the entire image frame) and
regression for modeling a continuous property variable (for instances of an
object class), a crucial use case in science and engineering. FastCAR involves
a label transformation approach that is amenable for use with only a
single-task regression network architecture. FastCAR outperforms traditional
MTL model families, parametrized in the landscape of architecture and loss
weighting schemes, when learning both tasks are collectively considered
(classification accuracy of 99.54%, regression mean absolute percentage error
of 2.4%). The experiments performed used "Advanced Steel Property Dataset"
contributed by us https://github.com/fastcandr/AdvancedSteel-Property-Dataset.
The dataset comprises 4536 images of 224x224 pixels, annotated with discrete
object classes and its hardness property that can take continuous values. Our
proposed FastCAR approach for task consolidation achieves training time
efficiency (2.52x quicker) and reduced inference latency (55% faster) than
benchmark MTL networks.

Motivation: 现有视频扩散技术在生成车祸场景时因数据稀缺而表现不佳，改进交通安全需要逼真且可控的事故模拟。

Method: 提出Ctrl-Crash模型，利用分类器自由引导技术，独立调节每个输入信号的权重，实现细粒度控制。

Result: 在定量（FVD、JEDi）和定性（人类评估）指标上均优于现有扩散方法。

Conclusion: Ctrl-Crash在生成逼真且可控的车祸视频方面表现出色，为交通安全研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Video diffusion techniques have advanced significantly in recent years;
however, they struggle to generate realistic imagery of car crashes due to the
scarcity of accident events in most driving datasets. Improving traffic safety
requires realistic and controllable accident simulations. To tackle the
problem, we propose Ctrl-Crash, a controllable car crash video generation model
that conditions on signals such as bounding boxes, crash types, and an initial
image frame. Our approach enables counterfactual scenario generation where
minor variations in input can lead to dramatically different crash outcomes. To
support fine-grained control at inference time, we leverage classifier-free
guidance with independently tunable scales for each conditioning signal.
Ctrl-Crash achieves state-of-the-art performance across quantitative video
quality metrics (e.g., FVD and JEDi) and qualitative measurements based on a
human-evaluation of physical realism and video quality compared to prior
diffusion-based methods.

Motivation: 自然灾害影响广泛，传统VQA模型需微调才能处理新问题，限制了实时响应能力。

Method: 利用大规模VLM的零样本学习能力，提出ZeShot-VQA方法，并在FloodNet数据集上验证性能。

Result: ZeShot-VQA无需微调即可处理新数据集和生成未见过的答案，展示了灵活性。

Conclusion: ZeShot-VQA为自然灾害响应提供了高效、灵活的解决方案，避免了传统方法的时间消耗。

Abstract: Natural disasters usually affect vast areas and devastate infrastructures.
Performing a timely and efficient response is crucial to minimize the impact on
affected communities, and data-driven approaches are the best choice. Visual
question answering (VQA) models help management teams to achieve in-depth
understanding of damages. However, recently published models do not possess the
ability to answer open-ended questions and only select the best answer among a
predefined list of answers. If we want to ask questions with new additional
possible answers that do not exist in the predefined list, the model needs to
be fin-tuned/retrained on a new collected and annotated dataset, which is a
time-consuming procedure. In recent years, large-scale Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have earned significant attention. These models are trained on extensive
datasets and demonstrate strong performance on both unimodal and multimodal
vision/language downstream tasks, often without the need for fine-tuning. In
this paper, we propose a VLM-based zero-shot VQA (ZeShot-VQA) method, and
investigate the performance of on post-disaster FloodNet dataset. Since the
proposed method takes advantage of zero-shot learning, it can be applied on new
datasets without fine-tuning. In addition, ZeShot-VQA is able to process and
generate answers that has been not seen during the training procedure, which
demonstrates its flexibility.

Motivation: 现有方法在视频多模态任务中生成的推理链未明确关联关键帧，导致性能受限。

Method: 创建CoF-Data数据集，包含多样化的视频问题、答案及帧关联推理链，并微调现有视频LLMs。

Result: CoF方法在多个视频理解基准测试中表现优异，减少了幻觉率。

Conclusion: CoF方法简单有效，无需辅助网络即可实现帧关联推理，显著提升视频LLMs性能。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that eliciting Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate
reasoning traces in natural language before answering the user's request can
significantly improve their performance across tasks. This approach has been
extended to multimodal LLMs, where the models can produce chain-of-thoughts
(CoT) about the content of input images and videos. In this work, we propose to
obtain video LLMs whose reasoning steps are grounded in, and explicitly refer
to, the relevant video frames. For this, we first create CoF-Data, a large
dataset of diverse questions, answers, and corresponding frame-grounded
reasoning traces about both natural and synthetic videos, spanning various
topics and tasks. Then, we fine-tune existing video LLMs on this
chain-of-frames (CoF) data. Our approach is simple and self-contained, and,
unlike existing approaches for video CoT, does not require auxiliary networks
to select or caption relevant frames. We show that our models based on CoF are
able to generate chain-of-thoughts that accurately refer to the key frames to
answer the given question. This, in turn, leads to improved performance across
multiple video understanding benchmarks, for example, surpassing leading video
LLMs on Video-MME, MVBench, and VSI-Bench, and notably reducing the
hallucination rate. Code available at

Motivation: 传统方法对所有像素使用统一的损失函数，忽略了像素和区域间学习难度的显著差异。

Method: 提出Difficulty Balancing (DB)损失和Occlusion Avoiding (OA)损失，分别针对学习难度不均和遮挡问题。

Result: 实验表明，结合DB和OA损失显著提升了光流和立体深度任务的性能。

Conclusion: 通过结合DB和OA损失，有效解决了训练中不同类型挑战性像素和区域的问题。

Abstract: Conventional training for optical flow and stereo depth models typically
employs a uniform loss function across all pixels. However, this
one-size-fits-all approach often overlooks the significant variations in
learning difficulty among individual pixels and contextual regions. This paper
investigates the uncertainty-based confidence maps which capture these
spatially varying learning difficulties and introduces tailored solutions to
address them. We first present the Difficulty Balancing (DB) loss, which
utilizes an error-based confidence measure to encourage the network to focus
more on challenging pixels and regions. Moreover, we identify that some
difficult pixels and regions are affected by occlusions, resulting from the
inherently ill-posed matching problem in the absence of real correspondences.
To address this, we propose the Occlusion Avoiding (OA) loss, designed to guide
the network into cycle consistency-based confident regions, where feature
matching is more reliable. By combining the DB and OA losses, we effectively
manage various types of challenging pixels and regions during training.
Experiments on both optical flow and stereo depth tasks consistently
demonstrate significant performance improvements when applying our proposed
combination of the DB and OA losses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习视觉跟踪方法取得了进展，但其在面对精心设计的对抗攻击时表现脆弱，导致性能急剧下降。

Method: DiffDf通过结合像素级重建损失、语义一致性损失和结构相似性损失，建立多尺度防御机制，逐步去噪以抑制对抗扰动。

Result: 在多个主流数据集上的实验表明，DiffDf对不同架构的跟踪器具有优秀的泛化性能，显著提升了各项评估指标，并实现了超过30 FPS的实时推理速度。

Conclusion: DiffDf展示了出色的防御性能和效率，为视觉跟踪对抗防御提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although deep learning-based visual tracking methods have made significant
progress, they exhibit vulnerabilities when facing carefully designed
adversarial attacks, which can lead to a sharp decline in tracking performance.
To address this issue, this paper proposes for the first time a novel
adversarial defense method based on denoise diffusion probabilistic models,
termed DiffDf, aimed at effectively improving the robustness of existing visual
tracking methods against adversarial attacks. DiffDf establishes a multi-scale
defense mechanism by combining pixel-level reconstruction loss, semantic
consistency loss, and structural similarity loss, effectively suppressing
adversarial perturbations through a gradual denoising process. Extensive
experimental results on several mainstream datasets show that the DiffDf method
demonstrates excellent generalization performance for trackers with different
architectures, significantly improving various evaluation metrics while
achieving real-time inference speeds of over 30 FPS, showcasing outstanding
defense performance and efficiency. Codes are available at

Motivation: 尽管潜在扩散模型在高维图像数据生成和下游任务中取得了进展，但在NR-IQA任务中感知一致性的研究较少。本文假设这些模型在数据流形中隐含地表现出感知一致的局部区域。

Method: 提出PMG算法，利用预训练的潜在扩散模型和感知质量特征，从去噪U-Net中提取感知一致的多尺度和多时间步特征图。

Result: 实验证明这些超特征与人类感知在IQA任务中高度相关，方法在IQA数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 本文首次将感知特征用于引导扩散模型进行NR-IQA任务，展示了扩散模型在NR-IQA任务中的优越泛化能力。

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in latent diffusion models that generate
high-dimensional image data and perform various downstream tasks, there has
been little exploration into perceptual consistency within these models on the
task of No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA). In this paper, we
hypothesize that latent diffusion models implicitly exhibit perceptually
consistent local regions within the data manifold. We leverage this insight to
guide on-manifold sampling using perceptual features and input measurements.
Specifically, we propose Perceptual Manifold Guidance (PMG), an algorithm that
utilizes pretrained latent diffusion models and perceptual quality features to
obtain perceptually consistent multi-scale and multi-timestep feature maps from
the denoising U-Net. We empirically demonstrate that these hyperfeatures
exhibit high correlation with human perception in IQA tasks. Our method can be
applied to any existing pretrained latent diffusion model and is
straightforward to integrate. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the
first work on guiding diffusion model with perceptual features for NR-IQA.
Extensive experiments on IQA datasets show that our method, LGDM, achieves
state-of-the-art performance, underscoring the superior generalization
capabilities of diffusion models for NR-IQA tasks.

Result: 在COCO和Objects365数据集上，VocAda显著提升了三种先进检测器的性能。

Conclusion: VocAda是一种通用且高效的词汇优化方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection models allow users to freely specify a class
vocabulary in natural language at test time, guiding the detection of desired
objects. However, vocabularies can be overly broad or even mis-specified,
hampering the overall performance of the detector. In this work, we propose a
plug-and-play Vocabulary Adapter (VocAda) to refine the user-defined
vocabulary, automatically tailoring it to categories that are relevant for a
given image. VocAda does not require any training, it operates at inference
time in three steps: i) it uses an image captionner to describe visible
objects, ii) it parses nouns from those captions, and iii) it selects relevant
classes from the user-defined vocabulary, discarding irrelevant ones.
Experiments on COCO and Objects365 with three state-of-the-art detectors show
that VocAda consistently improves performance, proving its versatility. The
code is open source.

Conclusion: 该框架在多模态多目标检测中表现出高效性和实用性，尤其适用于资源受限的设备。

Abstract: In the surveillance and defense domain, multi-target detection and
classification (MTD) is considered essential yet challenging due to
heterogeneous inputs from diverse data sources and the computational complexity
of algorithms designed for resource-constrained embedded devices, particularly
for Al-based solutions. To address these challenges, we propose a feature
fusion and knowledge-distilled framework for multi-modal MTD that leverages
data fusion to enhance accuracy and employs knowledge distillation for improved
domain adaptation. Specifically, our approach utilizes both RGB and thermal
image inputs within a novel fusion-based multi-modal model, coupled with a
distillation training pipeline. We formulate the problem as a posterior
probability optimization task, which is solved through a multi-stage training
pipeline supported by a composite loss function. This loss function effectively
transfers knowledge from a teacher model to a student model. Experimental
results demonstrate that our student model achieves approximately 95% of the
teacher model's mean Average Precision while reducing inference time by
approximately 50%, underscoring its suitability for practical MTD deployment
scenarios.

Abstract: Existing prompt-based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance in
continual learning, leveraging pre-trained large-scale models for
classification tasks; however, the tight coupling between foreground-background
information and the coupled attention between prompts and image-text tokens
present significant challenges in incremental medical object detection tasks,
due to the conceptual gap between medical and natural domains. To overcome
these challenges, we introduce the \method~framework, which comprises two main
components: 1) Instance-level Prompt Generation (\ipg), which decouples
fine-grained instance-level knowledge from images and generates prompts that
focus on dense predictions, and 2) Decoupled Prompt Attention (\dpa), which
decouples the original prompt attention, enabling a more direct and efficient
transfer of prompt information while reducing memory usage and mitigating
catastrophic forgetting. We collect 13 clinical, cross-modal, multi-organ, and
multi-category datasets, referred to as \dataset, and experiments demonstrate
that \method~outperforms existing SOTA methods, with FAP improvements of

Result: 在超高清图像合成中，LWD 显著提升感知质量并降低FID，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 频率感知和信号驱动的监督是高效高分辨率生成建模的有效方法。

Abstract: High-resolution image synthesis remains a core challenge in generative
modeling, particularly in balancing computational efficiency with the
preservation of fine-grained visual detail. We present Latent Wavelet Diffusion
(LWD), a lightweight framework that enables any latent diffusion model to scale
to ultra-high-resolution image generation (2K to 4K) for free. LWD introduces
three key components: (1) a scale-consistent variational autoencoder objective
that enhances the spectral fidelity of latent representations; (2) wavelet
energy maps that identify and localize detail-rich spatial regions within the
latent space; and (3) a time-dependent masking strategy that focuses denoising
supervision on high-frequency components during training. LWD requires no
architectural modifications and incurs no additional computational overhead.
Despite its simplicity, it consistently improves perceptual quality and reduces
FID in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis, outperforming strong baseline
models. These results highlight the effectiveness of frequency-aware,
signal-driven supervision as a principled and efficient approach for
high-resolution generative modeling.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the crucial task of brain tumor segmentation in
medical imaging and propose innovative approaches to enhance its performance.
The current state-of-the-art nnU-Net has shown promising results but suffers
from extensive training requirements and underutilization of pre-trained
weights. To overcome these limitations, we integrate Axial-Coronal-Sagittal
convolutions and pre-trained weights from ImageNet into the nnU-Net framework,
resulting in reduced training epochs, reduced trainable parameters, and
improved efficiency. Two strategies for transferring 2D pre-trained weights to
the 3D domain are presented, ensuring the preservation of learned relationships
and feature representations critical for effective information propagation.
Furthermore, we explore a joint classification and segmentation model that
leverages pre-trained encoders from a brain glioma grade classification proxy
task, leading to enhanced segmentation performance, especially for challenging
tumor labels. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods in the
fast training settings achieve comparable or even outperform the ensemble of

well on these characters can generalize effectively to languages of similar or
lower structural complexity. To this end, we introduce SynergiProtoNet, a
hybrid network designed to improve the recognition accuracy of handwritten
characters and digits. The model integrates advanced clustering techniques with
a robust embedding framework to capture fine-grained details and contextual
nuances. It leverages multi-level (both high- and low-level) feature extraction
within a prototypical learning framework. We rigorously benchmark
SynergiProtoNet against several state-of-the-art few-shot learning models:
BD-CSPN, Prototypical Network, Relation Network, Matching Network, and
SimpleShot, across diverse evaluation settings including Monolingual
Intra-Dataset Evaluation, Monolingual Inter-Dataset Evaluation, Cross-Lingual
Transfer, and Split Digit Testing. Experimental results show that
SynergiProtoNet consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new
benchmark in few-shot learning for handwritten character and digit recognition.

TL;DR: BAGNet是一种基于边界感知的图注意力网络，通过优化边界点特征提取和全局特征池化，提高了点云语义分割的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云数据的不规则性和无结构特性使得语义分割具有挑战性，传统图方法计算成本高。

Method: 提出BAGNet，包含边界感知图注意力层（BAGLayer）和轻量级注意力池化层，分别优化边界点特征提取和全局特征。

Result: 在标准数据集上，BAGNet在准确性和推理时间上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BAGNet通过边界感知和轻量级设计，显著提升了点云语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Since the point cloud data is inherently irregular and unstructured, point
cloud semantic segmentation has always been a challenging task. The graph-based
method attempts to model the irregular point cloud by representing it as a
graph; however, this approach incurs substantial computational cost due to the
necessity of constructing a graph for every point within a large-scale point
cloud. In this paper, we observe that boundary points possess more intricate
spatial structural information and develop a novel graph attention network
known as the Boundary-Aware Graph attention Network (BAGNet). On one hand,
BAGNet contains a boundary-aware graph attention layer (BAGLayer), which
employs edge vertex fusion and attention coefficients to capture features of
boundary points, reducing the computation time. On the other hand, BAGNet
employs a lightweight attention pooling layer to extract the global feature of
the point cloud to maintain model accuracy. Extensive experiments on standard
datasets demonstrate that BAGNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in point
cloud semantic segmentation with higher accuracy and less inference time.

TL;DR: UNSURF是一种新型不确定性测量方法，用于临床脑MRI扫描的皮质表面重建，适用于任意方向、分辨率和对比度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的不确定性测量方法（如体素蒙特卡洛方差）不适合建模表面放置的不确定性。

Method: 通过预测体素符号距离函数（SDF）与实际拟合表面SDF之间的差异来衡量不确定性。

Result: UNSURF估计与真实误差相关性良好，支持自动化质量控制，并提升阿尔茨海默病分类任务性能。

Conclusion: UNSURF为临床脑MRI扫描的皮质表面重建提供了一种有效的不确定性测量工具。

Abstract: We propose UNSURF, a novel uncertainty measure for cortical surface
reconstruction of clinical brain MRI scans of any orientation, resolution, and
contrast. It relies on the discrepancy between predicted voxel-wise signed
distance functions (SDFs) and the actual SDFs of the fitted surfaces. Our
experiments on real clinical scans show that traditional uncertainty measures,
such as voxel-wise Monte Carlo variance, are not suitable for modeling the
uncertainty of surface placement. Our results demonstrate that UNSURF estimates
correlate well with the ground truth errors and: \textit{(i)}~enable effective
automated quality control of surface reconstructions at the subject-, parcel-,
mesh node-level; and \textit{(ii)}~improve performance on a downstream
Alzheimer's disease classification task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的测试时自适应（TTA）框架SSAM，通过双阶段关联学习动态优化图像编码器，解决了现有方法因缺乏显式监督而冻结编码器的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTA方法通常冻结图像编码器，忽视了其在缓解训练与测试数据分布偏移中的关键作用。

Method: SSAM通过软原型估计（SPE）和原型锚定图像重建（PIR）实现动态编码器优化。

Result: 实验表明，SSAM在多个基准测试中显著优于现有TTA方法，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: SSAM的架构无关设计和低超参数依赖性使其具有广泛的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Test-time adaption (TTA) has witnessed important progress in recent years,
the prevailing methods typically first encode the image and the text and design
strategies to model the association between them. Meanwhile, the image encoder
is usually frozen due to the absence of explicit supervision in TTA scenarios.
We identify a critical limitation in this paradigm: While test-time images
often exhibit distribution shifts from training data, existing methods
persistently freeze the image encoder due to the absence of explicit
supervision during adaptation. This practice overlooks the image encoder's
crucial role in bridging distribution shift between training and test. To
address this challenge, we propose SSAM (Self-Supervised Association Modeling),
a new TTA framework that enables dynamic encoder refinement through dual-phase
association learning. Our method operates via two synergistic components: 1)
Soft Prototype Estimation (SPE), which estimates probabilistic category
associations to guide feature space reorganization, and 2) Prototype-anchored
Image Reconstruction (PIR), enforcing encoder stability through
cluster-conditional image feature reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments
across diverse baseline methods and benchmarks demonstrate that SSAM can
surpass state-of-the-art TTA baselines by a clear margin while maintaining
computational efficiency. The framework's architecture-agnostic design and
minimal hyperparameter dependence further enhance its practical applicability.

Motivation: 解决传统DMD在大规模流式文本到图像模型（如SD 3.5和FLUX）上的收敛困难问题。

Method: 提出隐式分布对齐（IDA）和段内引导（ISG），并结合其他改进（如放大判别器模型）开发SenseFlow模型。

Result: SenseFlow在扩散模型（如SDXL）和流匹配模型（如SD 3.5 Large和FLUX）的蒸馏中表现优异。

Conclusion: SenseFlow通过IDA和ISG成功解决了DMD的收敛问题，并在多个模型中实现了高性能蒸馏。

Abstract: The Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) has been successfully applied to
text-to-image diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion (SD) 1.5. However,
vanilla DMD suffers from convergence difficulties on large-scale flow-based
text-to-image models, such as SD 3.5 and FLUX. In this paper, we first analyze
the issues when applying vanilla DMD on large-scale models. Then, to overcome
the scalability challenge, we propose implicit distribution alignment (IDA) to
regularize the distance between the generator and fake distribution.
Furthermore, we propose intra-segment guidance (ISG) to relocate the timestep
importance distribution from the teacher model. With IDA alone, DMD converges
for SD 3.5; employing both IDA and ISG, DMD converges for SD 3.5 and FLUX.1
dev. Along with other improvements such as scaled up discriminator models, our
final model, dubbed \textbf{SenseFlow}, achieves superior performance in
distillation for both diffusion based text-to-image models such as SDXL, and
flow-matching models such as SD 3.5 Large and FLUX. The source code will be

Abstract: Photomechanics is a crucial branch of solid mechanics. The localization of
point targets constitutes a fundamental problem in optical experimental
mechanics, with extensive applications in various missions of UAVs. Localizing
moving targets is crucial for analyzing their motion characteristics and
dynamic properties. Reconstructing the trajectories of points from asynchronous
cameras is a significant challenge. It encompasses two coupled sub-problems:
trajectory reconstruction and camera synchronization. Present methods typically
address only one of these sub-problems individually. This paper proposes a 3D
trajectory reconstruction method for point targets based on asynchronous
cameras, simultaneously solving both sub-problems. Firstly, we extend the
trajectory intersection method to asynchronous cameras to resolve the
limitation of traditional triangulation that requires camera synchronization.
Secondly, we develop models for camera temporal information and target motion,
based on imaging mechanisms and target dynamics characteristics. The parameters
are optimized simultaneously to achieve trajectory reconstruction without
accurate time parameters. Thirdly, we optimize the camera rotations alongside
the camera time information and target motion parameters, using tighter and
more continuous constraints on moving points. The reconstruction accuracy is
significantly improved, especially when the camera rotations are inaccurate.
Finally, the simulated and real-world experimental results demonstrate the
feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. The real-world results
indicate that the proposed algorithm achieved a localization error of 112.95 m
at an observation range of 15 ~ 20 km.

Method: 提出ViVo数据集，包含多视角RGB和深度视频对、2D前景掩码和3D点云，并扩展了多样性定义。

Result: 通过测试现有方法，证明了数据集的挑战性和现有算法的局限性。

Conclusion: ViVo数据集推动了体积视频重建和压缩算法的进一步发展。

Abstract: As research on neural volumetric video reconstruction and compression
flourishes, there is a need for diverse and realistic datasets, which can be
used to develop and validate reconstruction and compression models. However,
existing volumetric video datasets lack diverse content in terms of both
semantic and low-level features that are commonly present in real-world
production pipelines. In this context, we propose a new dataset, ViVo, for
VolumetrIc VideO reconstruction and compression. The dataset is faithful to
real-world volumetric video production and is the first dataset to extend the
definition of diversity to include both human-centric characteristics (skin,
hair, etc.) and dynamic visual phenomena (transparent, reflective, liquid,
etc.). Each video sequence in this database contains raw data including
fourteen multi-view RGB and depth video pairs, synchronized at 30FPS with
per-frame calibration and audio data, and their associated 2-D foreground masks
and 3-D point clouds. To demonstrate the use of this database, we have
benchmarked three state-of-the-art (SotA) 3-D reconstruction methods and two
volumetric video compression algorithms. The obtained results evidence the
challenging nature of the proposed dataset and the limitations of existing
datasets for both volumetric video reconstruction and compression tasks,
highlighting the need to develop more effective algorithms for these
applications. The database and the associated results are available at

Result: 实验表明FAITH模型在序列编辑任务中有效，SEED数据集为研究提供了挑战性资源。

Conclusion: SEED和FAITH为序列面部编辑任务提供了新的研究工具和基准。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently enabled precise and photorealistic facial
editing across a wide range of semantic attributes. Beyond single-step
modifications, a growing class of applications now demands the ability to
analyze and track sequences of progressive edits, such as stepwise changes to
hair, makeup, or accessories. However, sequential editing introduces
significant challenges in edit attribution and detection robustness, further
complicated by the lack of large-scale, finely annotated benchmarks tailored
explicitly for this task. We introduce SEED, a large-scale Sequentially Edited
facE Dataset constructed via state-of-the-art diffusion models. SEED contains
over 90,000 facial images with one to four sequential attribute modifications,
generated using diverse diffusion-based editing pipelines (LEdits, SDXL, SD3).
Each image is annotated with detailed edit sequences, attribute masks, and
prompts, facilitating research on sequential edit tracking, visual provenance
analysis, and manipulation robustness assessment. To benchmark this task, we
propose FAITH, a frequency-aware transformer-based model that incorporates
high-frequency cues to enhance sensitivity to subtle sequential changes.
Comprehensive experiments, including systematic comparisons of multiple
frequency-domain methods, demonstrate the effectiveness of FAITH and the unique
challenges posed by SEED. SEED offers a challenging and flexible resource for
studying progressive diffusion-based edits at scale. Dataset and code will be
publicly released at: https://github.com/Zeus1037/SEED.

Conclusion: CReFT-CAD为CAD推理研究提供了新思路，TriView2CAD基准为未来研究提供了资源。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a pivotal role in industrial manufacturing.
Orthographic projection reasoning underpins the entire CAD workflow,
encompassing design, manufacturing, and simulation. However, prevailing
deep-learning approaches employ standard 3D reconstruction pipelines as an
alternative, which often introduce imprecise dimensions and limit the
parametric editability required for CAD workflows. Recently, some researchers
adopt vision-language models (VLMs), particularly supervised fine-tuning (SFT),
to tackle CAD-related challenges. SFT shows promise but often devolves into
pattern memorization, yielding poor out-of-distribution performance on complex
reasoning tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce CReFT-CAD, a two-stage
fine-tuning paradigm that first employs a curriculum-driven reinforcement
learning stage with difficulty-aware rewards to build reasoning ability
steadily, and then applies supervised post-tuning to hone instruction following
and semantic extraction. Complementing this, we release TriView2CAD, the first
large-scale, open-source benchmark for orthographic projection reasoning,
comprising 200,000 synthetic and 3,000 real-world orthographic projections with
precise dimension annotations and six interoperable data modalities. We
benchmark leading VLMs on orthographic projection reasoning and demonstrate
that CReFT-CAD substantially improves reasoning accuracy and
out-of-distribution generalizability in real-world scenarios, offering valuable
insights for advancing CAD reasoning research.

Abstract: The characterization of mechanical properties for high-dynamic, high-velocity
target motion is essential in industries. It provides crucial data for
validating weapon systems and precision manufacturing processes etc. However,
existing measurement methods face challenges such as limited dynamic range,
discontinuous observations, and high costs. This paper presents a new approach
leveraging an event-based multi-view photogrammetric system, which aims to
address the aforementioned challenges. First, the monotonicity in the
spatiotemporal distribution of events is leveraged to extract the target's
leading-edge features, eliminating the tailing effect that complicates motion
measurements. Then, reprojection error is used to associate events with the
target's trajectory, providing more data than traditional intersection methods.
Finally, a target velocity decay model is employed to fit the data, enabling
accurate motion measurements via ours multi-view data joint computation. In a
light gas gun fragment test, the proposed method showed a measurement deviation
of 4.47% compared to the electromagnetic speedometer.

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态成像配准提供了一种高效且无需外部信息的解决方案，有望推动前列腺癌诊断的进步。

Abstract: The diagnosis of prostate cancer increasingly depends on multimodal imaging,
particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transrectal ultrasound
(TRUS). However, accurate registration between these modalities remains a
fundamental challenge due to the differences in dimensionality and anatomical
representations. In this work, we present a novel framework that addresses
these challenges through a two-stage process: TRUS 3D reconstruction followed
by cross-modal registration. Unlike existing TRUS 3D reconstruction methods
that rely heavily on external probe tracking information, we propose a totally
probe-location-independent approach that leverages the natural correlation
between sagittal and transverse TRUS views. With the help of our
clustering-based feature matching method, we enable the spatial localization of
2D frames without any additional probe tracking information. For the
registration stage, we introduce an unsupervised diffusion-based framework
guided by modality translation. Unlike existing methods that translate one
modality into another, we map both MR and US into a pseudo intermediate
modality. This design enables us to customize it to retain only
registration-critical features, greatly easing registration. To further enhance
anatomical alignment, we incorporate an anatomy-aware registration strategy
that prioritizes internal structural coherence while adaptively reducing the
influence of boundary inconsistencies. Extensive validation demonstrates that
our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior
registration accuracy with physically realistic deformations in a completely
unsupervised fashion.

Conclusion: Seg2Any通过创新的解耦和隔离机制，显著提升了S2I生成的语义和形状一致性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion models, top-tier text-to-image (T2I)
models still struggle to achieve precise spatial layout control, i.e.
accurately generating entities with specified attributes and locations.
Segmentation-mask-to-image (S2I) generation has emerged as a promising solution
by incorporating pixel-level spatial guidance and regional text prompts.
However, existing S2I methods fail to simultaneously ensure semantic
consistency and shape consistency. To address these challenges, we propose
Seg2Any, a novel S2I framework built upon advanced multimodal diffusion
transformers (e.g. FLUX). First, to achieve both semantic and shape
consistency, we decouple segmentation mask conditions into regional semantic
and high-frequency shape components. The regional semantic condition is
introduced by a Semantic Alignment Attention Mask, ensuring that generated
entities adhere to their assigned text prompts. The high-frequency shape
condition, representing entity boundaries, is encoded as an Entity Contour Map
and then introduced as an additional modality via multi-modal attention to
guide image spatial structure. Second, to prevent attribute leakage across
entities in multi-entity scenarios, we introduce an Attribute Isolation
Attention Mask mechanism, which constrains each entity's image tokens to attend
exclusively to themselves during image self-attention. To support open-set S2I
generation, we construct SACap-1M, a large-scale dataset containing 1 million
images with 5.9 million segmented entities and detailed regional captions,
along with a SACap-Eval benchmark for comprehensive S2I evaluation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Seg2Any achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both open-set and closed-set S2I benchmarks, particularly in fine-grained
spatial and attribute control of entities.

using two high-precision industrial cameras and one commercially available

Abstract: Generating continuous ground-level video from satellite imagery is a
challenging task with significant potential for applications in simulation,
autonomous navigation, and digital twin cities. Existing approaches primarily
focus on synthesizing individual ground-view images, often relying on auxiliary
inputs like height maps or handcrafted projections, and fall short in producing
temporally consistent sequences. In this paper, we propose {SatDreamer360}, a
novel framework that generates geometrically and temporally consistent
ground-view video from a single satellite image and a predefined trajectory. To
bridge the large viewpoint gap, we introduce a compact tri-plane representation
that encodes scene geometry directly from the satellite image. A ray-based
pixel attention mechanism retrieves view-dependent features from the tri-plane,
enabling accurate cross-view correspondence without requiring additional
geometric priors. To ensure multi-frame consistency, we propose an
epipolar-constrained temporal attention module that aligns features across
frames using the known relative poses along the trajectory. To support
evaluation, we introduce {VIGOR++}, a large-scale dataset for cross-view video
generation, with dense trajectory annotations and high-quality ground-view
sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SatDreamer360 achieves
superior performance in fidelity, coherence, and geometric alignment across
diverse urban scenes.

Abstract: With the advancement of modern medicine and the development of technologies
such as MRI, CT, and cellular analysis, it has become increasingly critical for
clinicians to accurately interpret various diagnostic images. However, modern
medical education often faces challenges due to limited access to high-quality
teaching materials, stemming from privacy concerns and a shortage of
educational resources (Balogh et al., 2015). In this context, image data
generated by machine learning models, particularly generative models, presents
a promising solution. These models can create diverse and comparable imaging
datasets without compromising patient privacy, thereby supporting modern
medical education. In this study, we explore the use of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and CycleGAN (Zhu et al., 2017) for generating synthetic
medical images. The source code is available at

*JungWoo Chae,Jiyoon Kim,Sangheum Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种并行重缩放技术，用于个性化扩散模型，通过分解一致性引导信号为并行和正交分量，以提升生成图像与文本提示的对齐和视觉保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如DreamBooth和Textual Inversion）在少量参考图像下容易过拟合，导致生成图像与文本提示不一致，Direct Consistency Optimization（DCO）对复杂或风格化提示效果有限。

Method: 提出并行重缩放技术，将一致性引导信号分解为与分类器自由引导（CFG）并行和正交的分量，重缩放并行分量以减少对CFG的干扰，同时保留主题身份。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在挑战性风格化提示下仍能提升提示对齐和视觉保真度，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 并行重缩放引导技术为多样化用户输入提供了更稳定和准确的个性化生成方案。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models to specific users or concepts remains
challenging, particularly when only a few reference images are available.
Existing methods such as DreamBooth and Textual Inversion often overfit to
limited data, causing misalignment between generated images and text prompts
when attempting to balance identity fidelity with prompt adherence. While
Direct Consistency Optimization (DCO) with its consistency-guided sampling
partially alleviates this issue, it still struggles with complex or stylized
prompts. In this paper, we propose a parallel rescaling technique for
personalized diffusion models. Our approach explicitly decomposes the
consistency guidance signal into parallel and orthogonal components relative to
classifier free guidance (CFG). By rescaling the parallel component, we
minimize disruptive interference with CFG while preserving the subject's
identity. Unlike prior personalization methods, our technique does not require
additional training data or expensive annotations. Extensive experiments show
improved prompt alignment and visual fidelity compared to baseline methods,
even on challenging stylized prompts. These findings highlight the potential of
parallel rescaled guidance to yield more stable and accurate personalization
for diverse user inputs.

TL;DR: PI-H2T通过特征融合和语义信息转移解决长尾数据中的表示空间和分类器偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长尾数据分布不均衡导致深度学习模型偏向头部类别，忽视尾部类别。

Method: 提出PI-H2T方法，包括PIF（置换不变表示融合）和H2TF（头到尾特征融合）。

Result: 实验证明PI-H2T优化了表示空间和决策边界，提升了尾部类别的多样性。

Conclusion: PI-H2T是一种即插即用的方法，能无缝集成到现有模型中，显著提升性能。

Abstract: The imbalanced distribution of long-tailed data presents a significant
challenge for deep learning models, causing them to prioritize head classes
while neglecting tail classes. Two key factors contributing to low recognition
accuracy are the deformed representation space and a biased classifier,
stemming from insufficient semantic information in tail classes. To address
these issues, we propose permutation-invariant and head-to-tail feature fusion
(PI-H2T), a highly adaptable method. PI-H2T enhances the representation space
through permutation-invariant representation fusion (PIF), yielding more
clustered features and automatic class margins. Additionally, it adjusts the
biased classifier by transferring semantic information from head to tail
classes via head-to-tail fusion (H2TF), improving tail class diversity.
Theoretical analysis and experiments show that PI-H2T optimizes both the
representation space and decision boundaries. Its plug-and-play design ensures
seamless integration into existing methods, providing a straightforward path to
further performance improvements. Extensive experiments on long-tailed
benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of PI-H2T.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合潜在扩散模型和3D对比视觉语言预训练方案的新架构，用于从文本生成3D CT图像，解决了高维度和解剖复杂性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管文本条件生成模型在2D医学图像合成上取得进展，但扩展到3D CT图像生成仍面临高维度、解剖复杂性和缺乏视觉语言对齐框架的挑战。

Method: 采用双编码器CLIP风格模型和预训练的3D VAE，结合潜在扩散模型，实现高效的3D去噪扩散生成。

Result: 在CT-RATE数据集上评估，模型在图像保真度、临床相关性和语义对齐方面表现优异，显著优于基线方法，并能有效增强下游诊断性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，模态特定的视觉语言对齐是高质量3D医学图像生成的关键，该方法为数据增强、医学教育和临床模拟提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Objective: While recent advances in text-conditioned generative models have
enabled the synthesis of realistic medical images, progress has been largely
confined to 2D modalities such as chest X-rays. Extending text-to-image
generation to volumetric Computed Tomography (CT) remains a significant
challenge, due to its high dimensionality, anatomical complexity, and the
absence of robust frameworks that align vision-language data in 3D medical
imaging. Methods: We introduce a novel architecture for Text-to-CT generation
that combines a latent diffusion model with a 3D contrastive vision-language
pretraining scheme. Our approach leverages a dual-encoder CLIP-style model
trained on paired CT volumes and radiology reports to establish a shared
embedding space, which serves as the conditioning input for generation. CT
volumes are compressed into a low-dimensional latent space via a pretrained
volumetric VAE, enabling efficient 3D denoising diffusion without requiring
external super-resolution stages. Results: We evaluate our method on the
CT-RATE dataset and conduct a comprehensive assessment of image fidelity,
clinical relevance, and semantic alignment. Our model achieves competitive
performance across all tasks, significantly outperforming prior baselines for
text-to-CT generation. Moreover, we demonstrate that CT scans synthesized by
our framework can effectively augment real data, improving downstream
diagnostic performance. Conclusion: Our results show that modality-specific
vision-language alignment is a key component for high-quality 3D medical image
generation. By integrating contrastive pretraining and volumetric diffusion,
our method offers a scalable and controllable solution for synthesizing
clinically meaningful CT volumes from text, paving the way for new applications
in data augmentation, medical education, and automated clinical simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIGC的快速发展引发了对知识产权保护和内容追溯的担忧，现有后生成水印方法存在计算开销大且难以平衡视频质量与水印提取的问题。

Method: 提出VIDSIG方法，通过部分微调潜在解码器，结合Perturbation-Aware Suppression（PAS）和轻量级Temporal Alignment模块，实现水印的隐式集成和时间一致性增强。

Result: 实验表明VIDSIG在水印提取、视觉质量和生成效率上表现最佳，且对空间和时间篡改具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VIDSIG是一种实用且高效的在生成过程中嵌入水印的方法，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has
led to significant progress in video generation but also raises serious
concerns about intellectual property protection and reliable content tracing.
Watermarking is a widely adopted solution to this issue, but existing methods
for video generation mainly follow a post-generation paradigm, which introduces
additional computational overhead and often fails to effectively balance the
trade-off between video quality and watermark extraction. To address these
issues, we propose Video Signature (VIDSIG), an in-generation watermarking
method for latent video diffusion models, which enables implicit and adaptive
watermark integration during generation. Specifically, we achieve this by
partially fine-tuning the latent decoder, where Perturbation-Aware Suppression
(PAS) pre-identifies and freezes perceptually sensitive layers to preserve
visual quality. Beyond spatial fidelity, we further enhance temporal
consistency by introducing a lightweight Temporal Alignment module that guides
the decoder to generate coherent frame sequences during fine-tuning.
Experimental results show that VIDSIG achieves the best overall performance in
watermark extraction, visual quality, and generation efficiency. It also
demonstrates strong robustness against both spatial and temporal tampering,
highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 低秩适应是一种有效的对抗攻击防御策略，适用于预训练视觉变换器的鲁棒性增强。

Abstract: Image classifiers, such as those used for autonomous vehicle navigation, are
largely known to be susceptible to adversarial attacks that target the input
image set. There is extensive discussion on adversarial attacks including
perturbations that alter the input images to cause malicious misclassifications
without perceivable modification. This work proposes a countermeasure for such
attacks by adjusting the weights and classes of pretrained vision transformers
with a low-rank adaptation to become more robust against adversarial attacks
and allow for scalable fine-tuning without retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多样化的视频类型和时长上缺乏通用性，需要一种统一的解决方案。

Conclusion: 提供了一种高效、可解释的解决方案，并计划未来增强音频感知分割和强化学习评分。

Abstract: Robust scene segmentation and keyframe extraction are essential preprocessing
steps in video understanding pipelines, supporting tasks such as indexing,
summarization, and semantic retrieval. However, existing methods often lack
generalizability across diverse video types and durations. We present a
unified, adaptive framework for automatic scene detection and keyframe
selection that handles formats ranging from short-form media to long-form
films, archival content, and surveillance footage. Our system dynamically
selects segmentation policies based on video length: adaptive thresholding for
short videos, hybrid strategies for mid-length ones, and interval-based
splitting for extended recordings. This ensures consistent granularity and
efficient processing across domains. For keyframe selection, we employ a
lightweight module that scores sampled frames using a composite metric of
sharpness, luminance, and temporal spread, avoiding complex saliency models
while ensuring visual relevance. Designed for high-throughput workflows, the
system is deployed in a commercial video analysis platform and has processed
content from media, education, research, and security domains. It offers a
scalable and interpretable solution suitable for downstream applications such
as UI previews, embedding pipelines, and content filtering. We discuss
practical implementation details and outline future enhancements, including
audio-aware segmentation and reinforcement-learned frame scoring.

Conclusion: CineMA为心脏影像提供了一种高效的基础模型，有望推动临床应用的快速转化。

Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a key investigation in clinical
cardiovascular medicine and has been used extensively in population research.
However, extracting clinically important measurements such as ejection fraction
for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases remains time-consuming and subjective.
We developed CineMA, a foundation AI model automating these tasks with limited
labels. CineMA is a self-supervised autoencoder model trained on 74,916 cine
CMR studies to reconstruct images from masked inputs. After fine-tuning, it was
evaluated across eight datasets on 23 tasks from four categories: ventricle and
myocardium segmentation, left and right ventricle ejection fraction
calculation, disease detection and classification, and landmark localisation.
CineMA is the first foundation model for cine CMR to match or outperform
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CineMA demonstrated greater label
efficiency than CNNs, achieving comparable or better performance with fewer
annotations. This reduces the burden of clinician labelling and supports
replacing task-specific training with fine-tuning foundation models in future
cardiac imaging applications. Models and code for pre-training and fine-tuning
are available at https://github.com/mathpluscode/CineMA, democratising access
to high-performance models that otherwise require substantial computational

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQGM的离散token代码库尚未被充分理解，尤其是哪些token对生成特定概念的图像至关重要。

Method: CORTEX采用两种方法：(1)样本级解释，分析单张图像中token的重要性；(2)代码库级解释，探索全局相关token。

Result: 实验证明CORTEX在解释token使用上优于基线方法，并支持目标图像编辑和快捷特征检测。

Conclusion: CORTEX不仅增强了VQGM的透明度，还在实际应用中展现了价值。

Abstract: Vector-Quantized Generative Models (VQGMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
image generation. However, the key component of VQGMs -- the codebook of
discrete tokens -- is still not well understood, e.g., which tokens are
critical to generate an image of a certain concept? This paper introduces
Concept-Oriented Token Explanation (CORTEX), a novel approach for interpreting
VQGMs by identifying concept-specific token combinations. Our framework employs
two methods: (1) a sample-level explanation method that analyzes token
importance scores in individual images, and (2) a codebook-level explanation
method that explores the entire codebook to find globally relevant tokens.
Experimental results demonstrate CORTEX's efficacy in providing clear
explanations of token usage in the generative process, outperforming baselines
across multiple pretrained VQGMs. Besides enhancing VQGMs transparency, CORTEX
is useful in applications such as targeted image editing and shortcut feature
detection. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangTianze009/CORTEX.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型化相机需求推动了对光学简化系统的探索，但简化系统常伴随严重像差，难以通过软件完全校正。

Method: 利用DPPs动态校正局部像差，通过可微分光学模型优化DPP变形，堆叠多张图像生成无像差合成图像。

Result: Fovea Stacking在扩展景深成像中优于传统方法，结合目标检测或眼动追踪可实现实时动态调整。

Conclusion: Fovea Stacking为小型化相机提供了一种高效像差校正方案，适用于监控和虚拟现实等应用。

Abstract: The desire for cameras with smaller form factors has recently lead to a push
for exploring computational imaging systems with reduced optical complexity
such as a smaller number of lens elements. Unfortunately such simplified
optical systems usually suffer from severe aberrations, especially in off-axis
regions, which can be difficult to correct purely in software.
  In this paper we introduce Fovea Stacking, a new type of imaging system that
utilizes emerging dynamic optical components called deformable phase plates
(DPPs) for localized aberration correction anywhere on the image sensor. By
optimizing DPP deformations through a differentiable optical model, off-axis
aberrations are corrected locally, producing a foveated image with enhanced
sharpness at the fixation point - analogous to the eye's fovea. Stacking
multiple such foveated images, each with a different fixation point, yields a
composite image free from aberrations. To efficiently cover the entire field of
view, we propose joint optimization of DPP deformations under imaging budget
constraints. Due to the DPP device's non-linear behavior, we introduce a neural
network-based control model for improved alignment between simulation-hardware
performance.
  We further demonstrated that for extended depth-of-field imaging, fovea
stacking outperforms traditional focus stacking in image quality. By
integrating object detection or eye-tracking, the system can dynamically adjust
the lens to track the object of interest-enabling real-time foveated video
suitable for downstream applications such as surveillance or foveated virtual
reality displays.

Motivation: 研究现代视觉模型是否能像人类视觉一样遵循Gestalt原则，并探索其训练条件。

Method: 使用Vision Transformers（ViT）和ConvNeXt模型，结合Masked Autoencoding（MAE）训练，并通过DiSRT测试平台评估全局结构敏感性。

Result: 自监督模型（如MAE、CLIP）在Gestalt任务中表现优于监督基线，甚至有时超过人类。分类微调会削弱这种能力，但Top-K激活稀疏机制可恢复。

Conclusion: 自监督训练促进Gestalt感知，DiSRT可作为评估模型全局结构敏感性的工具。

Abstract: Human vision organizes local cues into coherent global forms using Gestalt
principles like closure, proximity, and figure-ground assignment -- functions
reliant on global spatial structure. We investigate whether modern vision
models show similar behaviors, and under what training conditions these emerge.
We find that Vision Transformers (ViTs) trained with Masked Autoencoding (MAE)
exhibit activation patterns consistent with Gestalt laws, including illusory
contour completion, convexity preference, and dynamic figure-ground
segregation. To probe the computational basis, we hypothesize that modeling
global dependencies is necessary for Gestalt-like organization. We introduce
the Distorted Spatial Relationship Testbench (DiSRT), which evaluates
sensitivity to global spatial perturbations while preserving local textures.
Using DiSRT, we show that self-supervised models (e.g., MAE, CLIP) outperform
supervised baselines and sometimes even exceed human performance. ConvNeXt
models trained with MAE also exhibit Gestalt-compatible representations,
suggesting such sensitivity can arise without attention architectures. However,
classification finetuning degrades this ability. Inspired by biological vision,
we show that a Top-K activation sparsity mechanism can restore global
sensitivity. Our findings identify training conditions that promote or suppress
Gestalt-like perception and establish DiSRT as a diagnostic for global
structure sensitivity across models.

Abstract: We present Common Inpainted Objects In-N-Out of Context (COinCO), a novel
dataset addressing the scarcity of out-of-context examples in existing vision
datasets. By systematically replacing objects in COCO images through
diffusion-based inpainting, we create 97,722 unique images featuring both
contextually coherent and inconsistent scenes, enabling effective context
learning. Each inpainted object is meticulously verified and categorized as in-
or out-of-context through a multimodal large language model assessment. Our
analysis reveals significant patterns in semantic priors that influence
inpainting success across object categories. We demonstrate three key tasks
enabled by COinCO: (1) training context classifiers that effectively determine
whether existing objects belong in their context; (2) a novel
Objects-from-Context prediction task that determines which new objects
naturally belong in given scenes at both instance and clique levels, and (3)
context-enhanced fake detection on state-of-the-art methods without
fine-tuning. COinCO provides a controlled testbed with contextual variations,
establishing a foundation for advancing context-aware visual understanding in

Method: 采用权重剪枝减少模型大小和计算负载，结合知识蒸馏提升小模型性能，并混合DenseNet与Involutional Layers以高效捕捉空间特征。

Result: 压缩后的ResNet50在PlantVillage和PaddyLeaf数据集上分别达到99.55%和98.99%准确率；DenseNet模型在高效优化下分别达到99.21%和93.96%准确率；混合模型分别达到98.87%和97.10%准确率。

Conclusion: 压缩模型适用于实时应用，支持精准农业和可持续耕作实践。

Abstract: Agriculture is vital for global food security, but crops are vulnerable to
diseases that impact yield and quality. While Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) accurately classify plant diseases using leaf images, their high
computational demands hinder their deployment in resource-constrained settings
such as smartphones, edge devices, and real-time monitoring systems. This study
proposes a two-step model compression approach integrating Weight Pruning and
Knowledge Distillation, along with the hybridization of DenseNet with
Involutional Layers. Pruning reduces model size and computational load, while
distillation improves the smaller student models performance by transferring
knowledge from a larger teacher network. The hybridization enhances the models
ability to capture spatial features efficiently. These compressed models are
suitable for real-time applications, promoting precision agriculture through
rapid disease identification and crop management. The results demonstrate
ResNet50s superior performance post-compression, achieving 99.55% and 98.99%
accuracy on the PlantVillage and PaddyLeaf datasets, respectively. The
DenseNet-based model, optimized for efficiency, recorded 99.21% and 93.96%
accuracy with a minimal parameter count. Furthermore, the hybrid model achieved
98.87% and 97.10% accuracy, supporting the practical deployment of
energy-efficient devices for timely disease intervention and sustainable

Conclusion: 利用2D图像作为中介的ArtiScene方法高效且通用，显著提升了3D场景生成的质量和灵活性。

Abstract: Designing 3D scenes is traditionally a challenging task that demands both
artistic expertise and proficiency with complex software. Recent advances in
text-to-3D generation have greatly simplified this process by letting users
create scenes based on simple text descriptions. However, as these methods
generally require extra training or in-context learning, their performance is
often hindered by the limited availability of high-quality 3D data. In
contrast, modern text-to-image models learned from web-scale images can
generate scenes with diverse, reliable spatial layouts and consistent, visually
appealing styles. Our key insight is that instead of learning directly from 3D
scenes, we can leverage generated 2D images as an intermediary to guide 3D
synthesis. In light of this, we introduce ArtiScene, a training-free automated
pipeline for scene design that integrates the flexibility of free-form
text-to-image generation with the diversity and reliability of 2D intermediary
layouts.
  First, we generate 2D images from a scene description, then extract the shape
and appearance of objects to create 3D models. These models are assembled into
the final scene using geometry, position, and pose information derived from the
same intermediary image. Being generalizable to a wide range of scenes and
styles, ArtiScene outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks by a large margin in
layout and aesthetic quality by quantitative metrics. It also averages a 74.89%
winning rate in extensive user studies and 95.07% in GPT-4o evaluation. Project

Abstract: Video processing for real-time analytics in resource-constrained environments
presents a significant challenge in balancing energy consumption and video
semantics. This paper addresses the problem of energy-efficient video
processing by proposing a system that dynamically optimizes processing
configurations to minimize energy usage on the edge, while preserving essential
video features for deep learning inference. We first gather an extensive
offline profile of various configurations consisting of device CPU frequencies,
frame filtering features, difference thresholds, and video bitrates, to
establish apriori knowledge of their impact on energy consumption and inference
accuracy. Leveraging this insight, we introduce an online system that employs
multi-objective Bayesian optimization to intelligently explore and adapt
configurations in real time. Our approach continuously refines processing
settings to meet a target inference accuracy with minimal edge device energy
expenditure. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in
reducing video processing energy use while maintaining high analytical
performance, offering a practical solution for smart devices and edge computing
applications.

objects. To address this, our paper presents a novel depth-aware framework for
MOT. We estimate depth using a zero-shot approach and incorporate it as an
independent feature in the association process. Additionally, we introduce a
Hierarchical Alignment Score that refines IoU by integrating both coarse
bounding box overlap and fine-grained (pixel-level) alignment to improve
association accuracy without requiring additional learnable parameters. To our
knowledge, this is the first MOT framework to incorporate 3D features
(monocular depth) as an independent decision matrix in the association step.
Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks
without any training nor fine-tuning. The code is available at

### [376] [Aiding Medical Diagnosis through Image Synthesis and Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00786)
*Kanishk Choudhary*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于文本描述生成逼真医学图像的系统，并通过分类模型验证其准确性。系统结合了稳定扩散模型和分类模型，在结肠组织病理学图像上取得了较高的生成和分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像资源缺乏多样性和可及性，影响了临床学习和诊断准确性。

Method: 使用LoRA微调预训练的稳定扩散模型，结合ResNet-18分类模型进行图像生成和验证。

Result: 生成模型F1得分为0.6727，分类模型准确率达99.76%。某些组织类型分类完美，但复杂结构仍有挑战。

Conclusion: 系统在医学图像生成和验证中表现出高可靠性，适用于诊断支持和临床教育，未来将优化提示准确性并扩展应用领域。

Abstract: Medical professionals, especially those in training, often depend on visual
reference materials to support an accurate diagnosis and develop pattern
recognition skills. However, existing resources may lack the diversity and
accessibility needed for broad and effective clinical learning. This paper
presents a system designed to generate realistic medical images from textual
descriptions and validate their accuracy through a classification model. A
pretrained stable diffusion model was fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) on the PathMNIST dataset, consisting of nine colorectal histopathology
tissue types. The generative model was trained multiple times using different
training parameter configurations, guided by domain-specific prompts to capture
meaningful features. To ensure quality control, a ResNet-18 classification
model was trained on the same dataset, achieving 99.76% accuracy in detecting
the correct label of a colorectal histopathological medical image. Generated
images were then filtered using the trained classifier and an iterative
process, where inaccurate outputs were discarded and regenerated until they
were correctly classified. The highest performing version of the generative
model from experimentation achieved an F1 score of 0.6727, with precision and
recall scores of 0.6817 and 0.7111, respectively. Some types of tissue, such as
adipose tissue and lymphocytes, reached perfect classification scores, while
others proved more challenging due to structural complexity. The
self-validating approach created demonstrates a reliable method for
synthesizing domain-specific medical images because of high accuracy in both
the generation and classification portions of the system, with potential
applications in both diagnostic support and clinical education. Future work
includes improving prompt-specific accuracy and extending the system to other
areas of medical imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HSCR的新方法，通过分层自对比奖励解决Med-VLMs中的模态不对齐问题，显著提升了模型的零样本性能和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Med-VLMs方法忽视了模态不对齐问题，导致临床场景中不可靠的响应。

Method: HSCR利用Med-VLMs生成不偏好响应，通过视觉标记丢弃分析模态耦合标记，并引入多级偏好优化策略。

Result: 在多个医疗任务中，HSCR显著提升了零样本性能和对齐效果，仅需2000条训练数据。

Conclusion: HSCR有效解决了Med-VLMs的模态对齐问题，提升了模型的实用性和可信度。

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) have achieved success across
various tasks, yet most existing methods overlook the modality misalignment
issue that can lead to untrustworthy responses in clinical settings. In this
paper, we propose Hierarchical Self-Contrastive Rewarding (HSCR), a novel
approach that addresses two critical challenges in Med-VLM alignment: 1)
Cost-effective generation of high-quality preference data; 2) Capturing nuanced
and context-aware preferences for improved alignment. HSCR first leverages the
inherent capability of Med-VLMs to generate dispreferred responses with higher
sampling probability. By analyzing output logit shifts after visual token
dropout, we identify modality-coupled tokens that induce misalignment and
derive an implicit alignment reward function. This function guides token
replacement with hallucinated ones during decoding, producing high-quality
dispreferred data. Furthermore, HSCR introduces a multi-level preference
optimization strategy, which extends beyond traditional adjacent-level
optimization by incorporating nuanced implicit preferences, leveraging relative
quality in dispreferred data to capture subtle alignment cues for more precise
and context-aware optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple medical
tasks, including Med-VQA, medical image captioning and instruction following,
demonstrate that HSCR not only enhances zero-shot performance but also
significantly improves modality alignment and trustworthiness with just 2,000
training entries.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TIME的多模态框架，结合TabPFN作为表格编码器，解决表格数据与图像数据融合中的标准化表示和缺失值处理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决表格数据缺乏标准化预训练表示和缺失值处理的挑战，尤其是在医疗应用中。

Method: 利用TabPFN作为冻结的表格编码器生成鲁棒嵌入，结合预训练视觉主干提取的图像特征，探索多种融合策略。

Result: 实验表明，TIME在完整和不完整的表格输入中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: TIME在真实世界的多模态学习场景中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Tabular-image multimodal learning, which integrates structured tabular data
with imaging data, holds great promise for a variety of tasks, especially in
medical applications. Yet, two key challenges remain: (1) the lack of a
standardized, pretrained representation for tabular data, as is commonly
available in vision and language domains; and (2) the difficulty of handling
missing values in the tabular modality, which are common in real-world medical
datasets. To address these issues, we propose the TabPFN-Integrated Multimodal
Engine (TIME), a novel multimodal framework that builds on the recently
introduced tabular foundation model, TabPFN. TIME leverages TabPFN as a frozen
tabular encoder to generate robust, strong embeddings that are naturally
resilient to missing data, and combines them with image features from
pretrained vision backbones. We explore a range of fusion strategies and
tabular encoders, and evaluate our approach on both natural and medical
datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TIME consistently outperforms
competitive baselines across both complete and incomplete tabular inputs,
underscoring its practical value in real-world multimodal learning scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为L3A的方法，用于解决多标签类增量学习中的标签缺失和类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签类增量学习（MLCIL）面临标签缺失和类别不平衡的挑战，需要一种无需存储历史样本的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: L3A包含两个模块：伪标签模块（PL）用于生成伪标签以解决标签缺失问题，加权分析分类器（WAC）通过样本特定权重平衡类别贡献。

Result: 在MS-COCO和PASCAL VOC数据集上的实验表明，L3A优于现有方法。

Conclusion: L3A是一种无需存储历史样本的有效方法，能够显著提升多标签类增量学习的性能。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to learn new classes
continually without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Multi-label CIL
(MLCIL) extends CIL to a real-world scenario where each sample may belong to
multiple classes, introducing several challenges: label absence, which leads to
incomplete historical information due to missing labels, and class imbalance,
which results in the model bias toward majority classes. To address these
challenges, we propose Label-Augmented Analytic Adaptation (L3A), an
exemplar-free approach without storing past samples. L3A integrates two key
modules. The pseudo-label (PL) module implements label augmentation by
generating pseudo-labels for current phase samples, addressing the label
absence problem. The weighted analytic classifier (WAC) derives a closed-form
solution for neural networks. It introduces sample-specific weights to
adaptively balance the class contribution and mitigate class imbalance.
Experiments on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate that L3A outperforms
existing methods in MLCIL tasks. Our code is available at
https://github.com/scut-zx/L3A.

Conclusion: QuantFace通过创新的量化策略和优化方法，有效解决了扩散模型在资源受限设备上的部署问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving remarkable performance in face
restoration. However, the heavy computations of diffusion models make it
difficult to deploy them on devices like smartphones. In this work, we propose
QuantFace, a novel low-bit quantization for one-step diffusion face restoration
models, where the full-precision (\ie, 32-bit) weights and activations are
quantized to 4$\sim$6-bit. We first analyze the data distribution within
activations and find that they are highly variant. To preserve the original
data information, we employ rotation-scaling channel balancing. Furthermore, we
propose Quantization-Distillation Low-Rank Adaptation (QD-LoRA) that jointly
optimizes for quantization and distillation performance. Finally, we propose an
adaptive bit-width allocation strategy. We formulate such a strategy as an
integer programming problem, which combines quantization error and perceptual
metrics to find a satisfactory resource allocation. Extensive experiments on
the synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
QuantFace under 6-bit and 4-bit. QuantFace achieves significant advantages over
recent leading low-bit quantization methods for face restoration. The code is

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of understanding human activities
from an egocentric perspective. Traditional activity recognition techniques
face unique challenges in egocentric videos due to the highly dynamic nature of
the head during many activities. We propose a framework that seeks to address
these challenges in a way that is independent of network architecture by
restricting the ego-video input to a stabilized, hand-focused video. We
demonstrate that this straightforward video transformation alone outperforms
existing egocentric video baselines on the Ego-Exo4D Fine-Grained Keystep
Recognition benchmark without requiring any alteration of the underlying model
infrastructure.

Abstract: The generation and editing of audio-conditioned talking portraits guided by
multimodal inputs, including text, images, and videos, remains under explored.
In this paper, we present SkyReels-Audio, a unified framework for synthesizing
high-fidelity and temporally coherent talking portrait videos. Built upon
pretrained video diffusion transformers, our framework supports infinite-length
generation and editing, while enabling diverse and controllable conditioning
through multimodal inputs. We employ a hybrid curriculum learning strategy to
progressively align audio with facial motion, enabling fine-grained multimodal
control over long video sequences. To enhance local facial coherence, we
introduce a facial mask loss and an audio-guided classifier-free guidance
mechanism. A sliding-window denoising approach further fuses latent
representations across temporal segments, ensuring visual fidelity and temporal
consistency across extended durations and diverse identities. More importantly,
we construct a dedicated data pipeline for curating high-quality triplets
consisting of synchronized audio, video, and textual descriptions.
Comprehensive benchmark evaluations show that SkyReels-Audio achieves superior
performance in lip-sync accuracy, identity consistency, and realistic facial
dynamics, particularly under complex and challenging conditions.

Abstract: The synchrotron light source, a cutting-edge large-scale user facility,
requires autonomous synchrotron beamline operations, a crucial technique that
should enable experiments to be conducted automatically, reliably, and safely
with minimum human intervention. However, current state-of-the-art synchrotron
beamlines still heavily rely on human safety oversight. To bridge the gap
between automated and autonomous operation, a computer vision-based system is
proposed, integrating deep learning and multiview cameras for real-time
collision detection. The system utilizes equipment segmentation, tracking, and
geometric analysis to assess potential collisions with transfer learning that
enhances robustness. In addition, an interactive annotation module has been
developed to improve the adaptability to new object classes. Experiments on a
real beamline dataset demonstrate high accuracy, real-time performance, and
strong potential for autonomous synchrotron beamline operations.

Conclusion: TrajICL通过上下文学习和优化示例选择方法，显著提升了行人轨迹预测的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Predicting accurate future trajectories of pedestrians is essential for
autonomous systems but remains a challenging task due to the need for
adaptability in different environments and domains. A common approach involves
collecting scenario-specific data and performing fine-tuning via
backpropagation. However, this process is often impractical on edge devices due
to constrained computational resources. To address this challenge, we introduce
TrajICL, an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for pedestrian trajectory
prediction that enables rapid adaptation without fine-tuning on the
scenario-specific data. We propose a spatio-temporal similarity-based example
selection (STES) method that selects relevant examples from previously observed
trajectories within the same scene by identifying similar motion patterns at
corresponding locations. To further refine this selection, we introduce
prediction-guided example selection (PG-ES), which selects examples based on
both the past trajectory and the predicted future trajectory, rather than
relying solely on the past trajectory. This approach allows the model to
account for long-term dynamics when selecting examples. Finally, instead of
relying on small real-world datasets with limited scenario diversity, we train
our model on a large-scale synthetic dataset to enhance its prediction ability
by leveraging in-context examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TrajICL achieves remarkable adaptation across both in-domain and cross-domain
scenarios, outperforming even fine-tuned approaches across multiple public
benchmarks. The code will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AIGC检测器存在潜在先验偏差，依赖初始噪声模式而非鲁棒生成伪影，导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出On-Manifold Adversarial Training (OMAT)，优化扩散模型的初始潜在噪声，生成在流形上的对抗样本。

Result: 实验表明，OMAT显著提升检测器的跨生成器性能，无需网络重新设计。

Conclusion: OMAT为未来数据集构建和检测器评估提供新思路，推动更鲁棒的AIGC取证方法发展。

Abstract: Current AIGC detectors often achieve near-perfect accuracy on images produced
by the same generator used for training but struggle to generalize to outputs
from unseen generators. We trace this failure in part to latent prior bias:
detectors learn shortcuts tied to patterns stemming from the initial noise
vector rather than learning robust generative artifacts. To address this, we
propose On-Manifold Adversarial Training (OMAT): by optimizing the initial
latent noise of diffusion models under fixed conditioning, we generate
on-manifold adversarial examples that remain on the generator's output
manifold-unlike pixel-space attacks, which introduce off-manifold perturbations
that the generator itself cannot reproduce and that can obscure the true
discriminative artifacts. To test against state-of-the-art generative models,
we introduce GenImage++, a test-only benchmark of outputs from advanced
generators (Flux.1, SD3) with extended prompts and diverse styles. We apply our
adversarial-training paradigm to ResNet50 and CLIP baselines and evaluate
across existing AIGC forensic benchmarks and recent challenge datasets.
Extensive experiments show that adversarially trained detectors significantly
improve cross-generator performance without any network redesign. Our findings
on latent-prior bias offer valuable insights for future dataset construction
and detector evaluation, guiding the development of more robust and
generalizable AIGC forensic methodologies.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在PRVR中通常将视频分割为固定长度的片段，导致事件边界模糊，且使用平均池化计算事件表示，引入不对齐问题。

Method: 提出UEM框架，包含PGVS模块（基于时间和语义相似性迭代分割事件）和CAER模块（通过跨注意力优化事件表示）。

Result: 在多个PRVR基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: UEM框架通过改进事件建模和表示，显著提升了PRVR任务的性能。

Abstract: Given a text query, partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR) aims to
retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant moments, wherein event modeling
is crucial for partitioning the video into smaller temporal events that
partially correspond to the text. Previous methods typically segment videos
into a fixed number of equal-length clips, resulting in ambiguous event
boundaries. Additionally, they rely on mean pooling to compute event
representations, inevitably introducing undesired misalignment. To address
these, we propose an Uneven Event Modeling (UEM) framework for PRVR. We first
introduce the Progressive-Grouped Video Segmentation (PGVS) module, to
iteratively formulate events in light of both temporal dependencies and
semantic similarity between consecutive frames, enabling clear event
boundaries. Furthermore, we also propose the Context-Aware Event Refinement
(CAER) module to refine the event representation conditioned the text's
cross-attention. This enables event representations to focus on the most
relevant frames for a given text, facilitating more precise text-video
alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on two PRVR benchmarks.

Motivation: 多模态情感识别（MER）因数据获取受限而性能提升困难，因此利用CLIP的语义知识增强多模态表征。

Method: 提出MER-CLIP框架，引入标签编码器将标签作为文本嵌入，设计跨模态解码器对齐多模态特征到共享空间。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MER-CLIP通过标签语义和多模态对齐显著提升了情感识别性能。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) aims to identify human emotions by
combining data from various modalities such as language, audio, and vision.
Despite the recent advances of MER approaches, the limitations in obtaining
extensive datasets impede the improvement of performance. To mitigate this
issue, we leverage a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based
architecture and its semantic knowledge from massive datasets that aims to
enhance the discriminative multimodal representation. We propose a label
encoder-guided MER framework based on CLIP (MER-CLIP) to learn emotion-related
representations across modalities. Our approach introduces a label encoder that
treats labels as text embeddings to incorporate their semantic information,
leading to the learning of more representative emotional features. To further
exploit label semantics, we devise a cross-modal decoder that aligns each
modality to a shared embedding space by sequentially fusing modality features
based on emotion-related input from the label encoder. Finally, the label
encoder-guided prediction enables generalization across diverse labels by
embedding their semantic information as well as word labels. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art MER methods on
the benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI.

Conclusion: Edge-IMI框架有效减少对高带宽云服务和昂贵硬件的依赖，提升现场推断效率。

Abstract: The construction industry faces significant challenges in optimizing
equipment utilization, as underused machinery leads to increased operational
costs and project delays. Accurate and timely monitoring of equipment activity
is therefore key to identifying idle periods and improving overall efficiency.
This paper presents the Edge-IMI framework for detecting idle construction
machinery, specifically designed for integration with surveillance camera
systems. The proposed solution consists of three components: object detection,
tracking, and idle state identification, which are tailored for execution on
resource-constrained, CPU-based edge computing devices. The performance of
Edge-IMI is evaluated using a combined dataset derived from the ACID and MOCS
benchmarks. Experimental results confirm that the object detector achieves an
F1 score of 71.75%, indicating robust real-world detection capabilities. The
logistic regression-based idle identification module reliably distinguishes
between active and idle machinery with minimal false positives. Integrating all
three modules, Edge-IMI enables efficient on-site inference, reducing reliance
on high-bandwidth cloud services and costly hardware accelerators. We also
evaluate the performance of object detection models on Raspberry Pi 5 and an
Intel NUC platforms, as example edge computing platforms. We assess the
feasibility of real-time processing and the impact of model optimization
techniques.

Abstract: Despite recent progress, most existing virtual try-on methods still struggle
to simultaneously address two core challenges: accurately aligning the garment
image with the target human body, and preserving fine-grained garment textures
and patterns. In this paper, we propose DS-VTON, a dual-scale virtual try-on
framework that explicitly disentangles these objectives for more effective
modeling. DS-VTON consists of two stages: the first stage generates a
low-resolution try-on result to capture the semantic correspondence between
garment and body, where reduced detail facilitates robust structural alignment.
The second stage introduces a residual-guided diffusion process that
reconstructs high-resolution outputs by refining the residual between the two
scales, focusing on texture fidelity. In addition, our method adopts a fully
mask-free generation paradigm, eliminating reliance on human parsing maps or
segmentation masks. By leveraging the semantic priors embedded in pretrained
diffusion models, this design more effectively preserves the person's
appearance and geometric consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DS-VTON achieves state-of-the-art performance in both structural alignment and
texture preservation across multiple standard virtual try-on benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该综述为理解和推进3D骨架动作识别领域提供了基础且结构化的路线图。

Abstract: With the inherent advantages of skeleton representation, 3D skeleton-based
action recognition has become a prominent topic in the field of computer
vision. However, previous reviews have predominantly adopted a model-oriented
perspective, often neglecting the fundamental steps involved in skeleton-based
action recognition. This oversight tends to ignore key components of
skeleton-based action recognition beyond model design and has hindered deeper,
more intrinsic understanding of the task. To bridge this gap, our review aims
to address these limitations by presenting a comprehensive, task-oriented
framework for understanding skeleton-based action recognition. We begin by
decomposing the task into a series of sub-tasks, placing particular emphasis on
preprocessing steps such as modality derivation and data augmentation. The
subsequent discussion delves into critical sub-tasks, including feature
extraction and spatio-temporal modeling techniques. Beyond foundational action
recognition networks, recently advanced frameworks such as hybrid
architectures, Mamba models, large language models (LLMs), and generative
models have also been highlighted. Finally, a comprehensive overview of public
3D skeleton datasets is presented, accompanied by an analysis of
state-of-the-art algorithms evaluated on these benchmarks. By integrating
task-oriented discussions, comprehensive examinations of sub-tasks, and an
emphasis on the latest advancements, our review provides a fundamental and
accessible structured roadmap for understanding and advancing the field of 3D

### [391] [Deep Temporal Reasoning in Video Language Models: A Cross-Linguistic Evaluation of Action Duration and Completion through Perfect Times](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00928)
*Olga Loginova,Sofía Ortega Loguinova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个多语言数据集Perfect Times，用于评估视频语言模型在时间推理上的表现，发现现有模型难以模拟人类的时间与因果推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过语言结构和视觉线索区分已完成和进行中的动作，但现有视频语言模型是否能真正理解时间动态尚不明确。

Method: 构建了一个多语言（英语、意大利语、俄语、日语）的多选题数据集Perfect Times，结合日常活动视频和完成性标签，测试模型的时间推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，即使最先进的模型在文本任务上表现优异，但在视频中模拟人类的时间与因果推理能力仍存在困难。

Conclusion: 研究强调了整合深度多模态线索以捕捉动作持续性和完成性的重要性，为视频语言模型的时间推理评估设定了新标准。

Abstract: Human perception of events is intrinsically tied to distinguishing between
completed (perfect and telic) and ongoing (durative) actions, a process
mediated by both linguistic structure and visual cues. In this work, we
introduce the \textbf{Perfect Times} dataset, a novel, quadrilingual (English,
Italian, Russian, and Japanese) multiple-choice question-answering benchmark
designed to assess video-language models (VLMs) on temporal reasoning. By
pairing everyday activity videos with event completion labels and
perfectivity-tailored distractors, our dataset probes whether models truly
comprehend temporal dynamics or merely latch onto superficial markers.
Experimental results indicate that state-of-the-art models, despite their
success on text-based tasks, struggle to mirror human-like temporal and causal
reasoning grounded in video. This study underscores the necessity of
integrating deep multimodal cues to capture the nuances of action duration and
completion within temporal and causal video dynamics, setting a new standard
for evaluating and advancing temporal reasoning in VLMs.

TL;DR: AD-SVFD是一种深度学习模型，用于血管形状的可变形配准和合成解剖结构的生成，通过点云和ODE建模实现高效优化和生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决血管形状配准和合成解剖结构生成的问题，提供高效且准确的解决方案。

Method: 使用加权点云表示几何形状，通过ODE建模空间变形，优化Chamfer距离，并采用自动解码器结构实现权重共享。

Result: 在健康主动脉解剖结构上展示了高质量结果，计算成本低且精度高。

Conclusion: AD-SVFD是一种高效且准确的模型，适用于血管形状配准和生成合成解剖结构。

Abstract: This work introduces AD-SVFD, a deep learning model for the deformable
registration of vascular shapes to a pre-defined reference and for the
generation of synthetic anatomies. AD-SVFD operates by representing each
geometry as a weighted point cloud and models ambient space deformations as
solutions at unit time of ODEs, whose time-independent right-hand sides are
expressed through artificial neural networks. The model parameters are
optimized by minimizing the Chamfer Distance between the deformed and reference
point clouds, while backward integration of the ODE defines the inverse
transformation. A distinctive feature of AD-SVFD is its auto-decoder structure,
that enables generalization across shape cohorts and favors efficient weight
sharing. In particular, each anatomy is associated with a low-dimensional code
that acts as a self-conditioning field and that is jointly optimized with the
network parameters during training. At inference, only the latent codes are
fine-tuned, substantially reducing computational overheads. Furthermore, the
use of implicit shape representations enables generative applications: new
anatomies can be synthesized by suitably sampling from the latent space and
applying the corresponding inverse transformations to the reference geometry.
Numerical experiments, conducted on healthy aortic anatomies, showcase the
high-quality results of AD-SVFD, which yields extremely accurate approximations
at competitive computational costs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TIGeR框架通过文本驱动生成和视觉引导细化，解决了3D重建中预定义模板的限制，提升了适应性和遮挡鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预定义的3D对象模板在重建手-物体交互时需大量手动工作且适应性受限，尤其是遮挡场景。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：文本指令生成先验和视觉引导细化，利用2D-3D协作注意力校准合成原型。

Result: 在Dex-YCB和Obman数据集上表现优异（Chamfer距离1.979和5.468），超越无模板方法。

Conclusion: TIGeR框架在遮挡下表现鲁棒，兼容多种先验源，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Pre-defined 3D object templates are widely used in 3D reconstruction of
hand-object interactions. However, they often require substantial manual
efforts to capture or source, and inherently restrict the adaptability of
models to unconstrained interaction scenarios, e.g., heavily-occluded objects.
To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a new Text-Instructed Generation and
Refinement (TIGeR) framework, harnessing the power of intuitive text-driven
priors to steer the object shape refinement and pose estimation. We use a
two-stage framework: a text-instructed prior generation and vision-guided
refinement. As the name implies, we first leverage off-the-shelf models to
generate shape priors according to the text description without tedious 3D
crafting. Considering the geometric gap between the synthesized prototype and
the real object interacted with the hand, we further calibrate the synthesized
prototype via 2D-3D collaborative attention. TIGeR achieves competitive
performance, i.e., 1.979 and 5.468 object Chamfer distance on the widely-used
Dex-YCB and Obman datasets, respectively, surpassing existing template-free
methods. Notably, the proposed framework shows robustness to occlusion, while
maintaining compatibility with heterogeneous prior sources, e.g., retrieved
hand-crafted prototypes, in practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for continual learning in anomaly
detection, aimed at better reflecting real-world deployment scenarios. Our
benchmark, Continual-MEGA, includes a large and diverse dataset that
significantly expands existing evaluation settings by combining carefully
curated existing datasets with our newly proposed dataset, ContinualAD. In
addition to standard continual learning with expanded quantity, we propose a
novel scenario that measures zero-shot generalization to unseen classes, those
not observed during continual adaptation. This setting poses a new problem
setting that continual adaptation also enhances zero-shot performance. We also
present a unified baseline algorithm that improves robustness in few-shot
detection and maintains strong generalization. Through extensive evaluations,
we report three key findings: (1) existing methods show substantial room for
improvement, particularly in pixel-level defect localization; (2) our proposed
method consistently outperforms prior approaches; and (3) the newly introduced
ContinualAD dataset enhances the performance of strong anomaly detection
models. We release the benchmark and code in

machine learning advancements, and hybrid methods that integrate multiple
strategies. Additionally, we gather and analyze the metrics and datasets
commonly used for evaluating camera trajectory systems, offering insights into
how these tools measure performance, aesthetic quality, and practical
applicability. Finally, we highlight existing limitations, critical gaps in
current research, and promising opportunities for investment and innovation in
the field. This paper not only serves as a foundational resource for
researchers entering the field but also paves the way for advancing adaptive,
efficient, and creative camera trajectory systems across diverse applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对单一分类器和固定相机姿态，忽略了多分类器系统和变化相机姿态的复杂性，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 开发了分类器无关的对抗损失和优化框架，结合注意力机制加权梯度，集中扰动于高分类激活区域。

Result: 实验表明，CAPAA在攻击成功率和隐蔽性上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: CAPAA为投影对抗攻击提供了一种更通用和鲁棒的解决方案，适用于多分类器和变化相机姿态场景。

Abstract: Projector-based adversarial attack aims to project carefully designed light
patterns (i.e., adversarial projections) onto scenes to deceive deep image
classifiers. It has potential applications in privacy protection and the
development of more robust classifiers. However, existing approaches primarily
focus on individual classifiers and fixed camera poses, often neglecting the
complexities of multi-classifier systems and scenarios with varying camera
poses. This limitation reduces their effectiveness when introducing new
classifiers or camera poses. In this paper, we introduce Classifier-Agnostic
Projector-Based Adversarial Attack (CAPAA) to address these issues. First, we
develop a novel classifier-agnostic adversarial loss and optimization framework
that aggregates adversarial and stealthiness loss gradients from multiple
classifiers. Then, we propose an attention-based gradient weighting mechanism
that concentrates perturbations on regions of high classification activation,
thereby improving the robustness of adversarial projections when applied to
scenes with varying camera poses. Our extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate that CAPAA achieves both a higher attack success rate and greater
stealthiness compared to existing baselines. Codes are available at:

Motivation: AIGC技术的快速发展带来了高度逼真的合成内容，但现有检测方法多为黑盒二元分类器，缺乏可解释性且无法统一处理图像和视频。

Method: 提出了IVY-FAKE数据集（包含15万训练样本和1.87万评估样本，附带详细自然语言标注），并开发了IVY-XDETECTOR，一种基于视觉语言模型的统一检测架构。

Result: IVY-XDETECTOR在多个图像和视频检测基准上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: IVY-FAKE数据集和IVY-XDETECTOR架构显著提升了AIGC检测的可解释性和统一性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) in
visual domains has resulted in highly realistic synthetic images and videos,
driven by sophisticated generative frameworks such as diffusion-based
architectures. While these breakthroughs open substantial opportunities, they
simultaneously raise critical concerns about content authenticity and
integrity. Many current AIGC detection methods operate as black-box binary
classifiers, which offer limited interpretability, and no approach supports
detecting both images and videos in a unified framework. This dual limitation
compromises model transparency, reduces trustworthiness, and hinders practical
deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce IVY-FAKE , a novel,
unified, and large-scale dataset specifically designed for explainable
multimodal AIGC detection. Unlike prior benchmarks, which suffer from
fragmented modality coverage and sparse annotations, IVY-FAKE contains over
150,000 richly annotated training samples (images and videos) and 18,700
evaluation examples, each accompanied by detailed natural-language reasoning
beyond simple binary labels. Building on this, we propose Ivy Explainable
Detector (IVY-XDETECTOR), a unified AIGC detection and explainable architecture
that jointly performs explainable detection for both image and video content.
Our unified vision-language model achieves state-of-the-art performance across
multiple image and video detection benchmarks, highlighting the significant
advancements enabled by our dataset and modeling framework. Our data is

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在几何光学领域的细粒度物理原理评估不足，需填补这一空白。

Method: 构建GOBench-Gen-1k数据集，通过主观实验评估生成图像的光学真实性、美学质量和指令忠实度，并设计评估指令测试11种MLLMs的光学理解能力。

Result: 当前模型在光学生成和理解任务中表现不佳，最佳生成模型GPT-4o-Image无法完美完成任务，最佳理解模型Gemini-2.5Pro准确率仅37.35%。

Conclusion: MLLMs在几何光学领域的生成和理解能力仍有显著提升空间，GOBench为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Multi-modality Large Language Models (MLLMs) is
driving significant advancements in visual understanding and generation.
Nevertheless, a comprehensive assessment of their capabilities, concerning the
fine-grained physical principles especially in geometric optics, remains
underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GOBench, the first benchmark
to systematically evaluate MLLMs' ability across two tasks: 1) Generating
Optically Authentic Imagery and 2) Understanding Underlying Optical Phenomena.
We curates high-quality prompts of geometric optical scenarios and use MLLMs to
construct GOBench-Gen-1k dataset.We then organize subjective experiments to
assess the generated imagery based on Optical Authenticity, Aesthetic Quality,
and Instruction Fidelity, revealing MLLMs' generation flaws that violate
optical principles. For the understanding task, we apply crafted evaluation
instructions to test optical understanding ability of eleven prominent MLLMs.
The experimental results demonstrate that current models face significant
challenges in both optical generation and understanding. The top-performing
generative model, GPT-4o-Image, cannot perfectly complete all generation tasks,
and the best-performing MLLM model, Gemini-2.5Pro, attains a mere 37.35\%
accuracy in optical understanding.

Result: 在CIFAR10、CIFAR100和SVHN数据集上，商数网络无需新增参数即可稳定超越ResNet。

Conclusion: 商数网络有效解决了ResNet的问题，同时保留了其优势，性能显著提升。

Abstract: The emergence of ResNet provides a powerful tool for training extremely deep
networks. The core idea behind it is to change the learning goals of the
network. It no longer learns new features from scratch but learns the
difference between the target and existing features. However, the difference
between the two kinds of features does not have an independent and clear
meaning, and the amount of learning is based on the absolute rather than the
relative difference, which is sensitive to the size of existing features. We
propose a new network that perfectly solves these two problems while still
having the advantages of ResNet. Specifically, it chooses to learn the quotient
of the target features with the existing features, so we call it the quotient
network. In order to enable this network to learn successfully and achieve
higher performance, we propose some design rules for this network so that it
can be trained efficiently and achieve better performance than ResNet.
Experiments on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN datasets prove that this network
can stably achieve considerable improvements over ResNet by simply making tiny
corresponding changes to the original ResNet network without adding new
parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解对视频大语言模型（VideoLLMs）提出了高计算和内存需求的挑战，需要一种高效的方法来减少冗余处理。

Method: FlexSelect包括两个关键组件：1）无训练的令牌排序管道，利用跨模态注意力权重估计令牌重要性；2）轻量级选择器，训练以复制这些排序并过滤冗余令牌。

Result: FlexSelect在多个长视频基准测试中表现优异，并显著加速模型处理（例如LLaVA-Video-7B模型速度提升高达9倍）。

Conclusion: FlexSelect作为一种即插即用模块，可无缝集成到多种VideoLLM架构中，为长视频理解提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding poses a significant challenge for video large
language models (VideoLLMs) due to prohibitively high computational and memory
demands. In this paper, we propose FlexSelect, a flexible and efficient token
selection strategy for processing long videos. FlexSelect identifies and
retains the most semantically relevant content by leveraging cross-modal
attention patterns from a reference transformer layer. It comprises two key
components: (1) a training-free token ranking pipeline that leverages faithful
cross-modal attention weights to estimate each video token's importance, and
(2) a rank-supervised lightweight selector that is trained to replicate these
rankings and filter redundant tokens. This generic approach can be seamlessly
integrated into various VideoLLM architectures, such as LLaVA-Video, InternVL
and Qwen-VL, serving as a plug-and-play module to extend their temporal context
length. Empirically, FlexSelect delivers strong gains across multiple
long-video benchmarks including VideoMME, MLVU, LongVB, and LVBench. Moreover,
it achieves significant speed-ups (for example, up to 9 times on a
LLaVA-Video-7B model), highlighting FlexSelect's promise for efficient
long-form video understanding. Project page available at:

Result: TIC-FT在条件保真度和视觉质量上优于现有基线，且训练和推理效率高。

Conclusion: TIC-FT为视频扩散模型的条件生成提供了一种灵活、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality
video synthesis, but controllable generation remains challenging, particularly
under limited data and compute. Existing fine-tuning methods for conditional
generation often rely on external encoders or architectural modifications,
which demand large datasets and are typically restricted to spatially aligned
conditioning, limiting flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce
Temporal In-Context Fine-Tuning (TIC-FT), an efficient and versatile approach
for adapting pretrained video diffusion models to diverse conditional
generation tasks. Our key idea is to concatenate condition and target frames
along the temporal axis and insert intermediate buffer frames with
progressively increasing noise levels. These buffer frames enable smooth
transitions, aligning the fine-tuning process with the pretrained model's
temporal dynamics. TIC-FT requires no architectural changes and achieves strong
performance with as few as 10-30 training samples. We validate our method
across a range of tasks, including image-to-video and video-to-video
generation, using large-scale base models such as CogVideoX-5B and Wan-14B.
Extensive experiments show that TIC-FT outperforms existing baselines in both
condition fidelity and visual quality, while remaining highly efficient in both
training and inference. For additional results, visit

Method: 采用基于损失和梯度的错误检测，结合四阶段伪标签细化流程（包括边界框生成、重复去除、类别验证和空间调整）。

Result: MJ-COCO在多个验证数据集上表现优于MS-COCO，AP和APS指标提升，小目标标注数量增加超过20万。

Conclusion: MJ-COCO通过自动化标注修正显著提升了数据集的准确性和模型性能。

Abstract: Benchmark object detection (OD) datasets play a pivotal role in advancing
computer vision applications such as autonomous driving, and surveillance, as
well as in training and evaluating deep learning-based state-of-the-art
detection models. Among them, MS-COCO has become a standard benchmark due to
its diverse object categories and complex scenes. However, despite its wide
adoption, MS-COCO suffers from various annotation issues, including missing
labels, incorrect class assignments, inaccurate bounding boxes, duplicate
labels, and group labeling inconsistencies. These errors not only hinder model
training but also degrade the reliability and generalization of OD models. To
address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive refinement framework and
present MJ-COCO, a newly re-annotated version of MS-COCO. Our approach begins
with loss and gradient-based error detection to identify potentially mislabeled
or hard-to-learn samples. Next, we apply a four-stage pseudo-labeling
refinement process: (1) bounding box generation using invertible
transformations, (2) IoU-based duplicate removal and confidence merging, (3)
class consistency verification via expert objects recognizer, and (4) spatial
adjustment based on object region activation map analysis. This integrated
pipeline enables scalable and accurate correction of annotation errors without
manual re-labeling. Extensive experiments were conducted across four validation
datasets: MS-COCO, Sama COCO, Objects365, and PASCAL VOC. Models trained on
MJ-COCO consistently outperformed those trained on MS-COCO, achieving
improvements in Average Precision (AP) and APS metrics. MJ-COCO also
demonstrated significant gains in annotation coverage: for example, the number
of small object annotations increased by more than 200,000 compared to MS-COCO.

Motivation: 解决图像域语义混合与视频之间的差距，实现可控的高质量视频合成。

Method: 利用对角去噪调度和类无关分割检测和跟踪对象，结合动量语义校正和伽马残差噪声稳定化确保时间一致性。

Result: 在SSIM、LPIPS和CASS等指标上优于现有基线，实现更高的空间一致性和运动连贯性。

Conclusion: MoCA-Video证明在扩散噪声轨迹中进行结构化操作可实现可控的高质量视频合成。

Abstract: We introduce MoCA-Video (Motion-Aware Concept Alignment in Video), a
training-free framework bridging the gap between image-domain semantic mixing
and video. Given a generated video and a user-provided reference image,
MoCA-Video injects the semantic features of the reference image into a specific
object within the video, while preserving the original motion and visual
context. Our approach leverages a diagonal denoising schedule and
class-agnostic segmentation to detect and track objects in the latent space and
precisely control the spatial location of the blended objects. To ensure
temporal coherence, we incorporate momentum-based semantic corrections and
gamma residual noise stabilization for smooth frame transitions. We evaluate
MoCA's performance using the standard SSIM, image-level LPIPS, temporal LPIPS,
and introduce a novel metric CASS (Conceptual Alignment Shift Score) to
evaluate the consistency and effectiveness of the visual shifts between the
source prompt and the modified video frames. Using self-constructed dataset,
MoCA-Video outperforms current baselines, achieving superior spatial
consistency, coherent motion, and a significantly higher CASS score, despite
having no training or fine-tuning. MoCA-Video demonstrates that structured
manipulation in the diffusion noise trajectory allows for controllable,
high-quality video synthesis.

Method: 提出AuralFuser模块，结合特征金字塔和音频引导对比学习，优化跨模态融合。

Result: 在公开基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AuralSAM2有效解决了音频与视觉模态融合的挑战，提升了分割精度。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) exhibits strong generalisation for promptable
segmentation in video clips; however, its integration with the audio modality
remains underexplored. Existing approaches mainly follow two directions: (1)
injecting adapters into the image encoder to receive audio signals, which
incurs efficiency costs during prompt engineering, and (2) leveraging
additional foundation models to generate visual prompts for the sounding
objects, which are often imprecisely localised, leading to misguidance in SAM2.
Moreover, these methods overlook the rich semantic interplay between
hierarchical visual features and other modalities, resulting in suboptimal
cross-modal fusion. In this work, we propose AuralSAM2, comprising the novel
AuralFuser module, which externally attaches to SAM2 to integrate features from
different modalities and generate feature-level prompts, guiding SAM2's decoder
in segmenting sounding targets. Such integration is facilitated by a feature
pyramid, further refining semantic understanding and enhancing object awareness
in multimodal scenarios. Additionally, the audio-guided contrastive learning is
introduced to explicitly align audio and visual representations and to also
mitigate biases caused by dominant visual patterns. Results on public
benchmarks show that our approach achieves remarkable improvements over the
previous methods in the field. Code is available at

### [405] [Modality Translation and Registration of MR and Ultrasound Images Using Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01025)
*Xudong Ma,Nantheera Anantrasirichai,Stefanos Bolomytis,Alin Achim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于层次特征解耦设计的解剖一致性模态转换网络（ACMT），用于解决多模态MR-US配准中的模态差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态MR-US配准对前列腺癌诊断至关重要，但现有方法难以对齐关键边界且对无关细节过于敏感。

Method: 通过浅层特征保持纹理一致性，深层特征保留边界，并引入中间伪模态设计，将MR和US图像转换至该域。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能减少模态差异并保留解剖边界，定量评估显示其模态相似性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 下游配准实验证实，ACMT转换的图像具有最佳对齐性能，框架在多模态前列腺图像配准中表现稳健。

Abstract: Multimodal MR-US registration is critical for prostate cancer diagnosis.
However, this task remains challenging due to significant modality
discrepancies. Existing methods often fail to align critical boundaries while
being overly sensitive to irrelevant details. To address this, we propose an
anatomically coherent modality translation (ACMT) network based on a
hierarchical feature disentanglement design. We leverage shallow-layer features
for texture consistency and deep-layer features for boundary preservation.
Unlike conventional modality translation methods that convert one modality into
another, our ACMT introduces the customized design of an intermediate pseudo
modality. Both MR and US images are translated toward this intermediate domain,
effectively addressing the bottlenecks faced by traditional translation methods
in the downstream registration task. Experiments demonstrate that our method
mitigates modality-specific discrepancies while preserving crucial anatomical
boundaries for accurate registration. Quantitative evaluations show superior
modality similarity compared to state-of-the-art modality translation methods.
Furthermore, downstream registration experiments confirm that our translated
images achieve the best alignment performance, highlighting the robustness of
our framework for multi-modal prostate image registration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NavBench是一个评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在零样本设置下导航能力的基准，包含导航理解和逐步执行两部分。研究发现GPT-4o表现优异，但大多数模型在时间理解方面存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MLLMs在具身环境中的理解和行动能力，填补其在导航任务中的研究空白。

Method: NavBench包含导航理解（3,200个问题-答案对）和逐步执行（432个场景），并开发了将MLLMs输出转化为机器人动作的流程。

Result: GPT-4o表现最佳，轻量开源模型在简单任务中成功；模型理解分数与执行性能正相关；地图上下文提升决策准确性。

Conclusion: MLLMs在导航任务中表现良好，但时间理解仍是主要挑战，未来需进一步优化。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
generalization in vision-language tasks, yet their ability to understand and
act within embodied environments remains underexplored. We present NavBench, a
benchmark to evaluate the embodied navigation capabilities of MLLMs under
zero-shot settings. NavBench consists of two components: (1) navigation
comprehension, assessed through three cognitively grounded tasks including
global instruction alignment, temporal progress estimation, and local
observation-action reasoning, covering 3,200 question-answer pairs; and (2)
step-by-step execution in 432 episodes across 72 indoor scenes, stratified by
spatial, cognitive, and execution complexity. To support real-world deployment,
we introduce a pipeline that converts MLLMs' outputs into robotic actions. We
evaluate both proprietary and open-source models, finding that GPT-4o performs
well across tasks, while lighter open-source models succeed in simpler cases.
Results also show that models with higher comprehension scores tend to achieve
better execution performance. Providing map-based context improves decision
accuracy, especially in medium-difficulty scenarios. However, most models
struggle with temporal understanding, particularly in estimating progress
during navigation, which may pose a key challenge.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的视频超分辨率方法因随机性易引入复杂退化和明显伪影，需改进。

Method: 结合自监督学习和Mamba，改进扩散模型为全局时空注意力机制，引入自监督ControlNet和对比学习，采用三阶段训练策略。

Result: 在真实世界视频超分辨率基准数据集上取得了优于现有技术的感知质量。

Conclusion: 提出的模型设计和训练策略有效，显著提升了视频超分辨率的效果。

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) methods are susceptible
to introducing complex degradations and noticeable artifacts into
high-resolution videos due to their inherent randomness. In this paper, we
propose a noise-robust real-world VSR framework by incorporating
self-supervised learning and Mamba into pre-trained latent diffusion models. To
ensure content consistency across adjacent frames, we enhance the diffusion
model with a global spatio-temporal attention mechanism using the Video
State-Space block with a 3D Selective Scan module, which reinforces coherence
at an affordable computational cost. To further reduce artifacts in generated
details, we introduce a self-supervised ControlNet that leverages HR features
as guidance and employs contrastive learning to extract degradation-insensitive
features from LR videos. Finally, a three-stage training strategy based on a
mixture of HR-LR videos is proposed to stabilize VSR training. The proposed
Self-supervised ControlNet with Spatio-Temporal Continuous Mamba based VSR
algorithm achieves superior perceptual quality than state-of-the-arts on
real-world VSR benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed
model design and training strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的PolSAR分类方法依赖大量标注数据且计算效率低，ECP-Mamba旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 结合多尺度自监督对比学习和Mamba架构（选择性SSM），采用螺旋扫描策略和轻量级Cross Mamba模块。

Result: 在Flevoland 1989数据集上达到99.70%的总体准确率，99.64%的平均准确率和99.62e-2的Kappa系数。

Conclusion: ECP-Mamba在PolSAR分类任务中表现出色，平衡了高精度和资源效率。

Abstract: Recently, polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification
has been greatly promoted by deep neural networks. However,current deep
learning-based PolSAR classification methods encounter difficulties due to its
dependence on extensive labeled data and the computational inefficiency of
architectures like Transformers. This paper presents ECP-Mamba, an efficient
framework integrating multi-scale self-supervised contrastive learning with a
state space model (SSM) backbone. Specifically, ECP-Mamba addresses annotation
scarcity through a multi-scale predictive pretext task based on local-to-global
feature correspondences, which uses a simplified self-distillation paradigm
without negative sample pairs. To enhance computational efficiency,the Mamba
architecture (a selective SSM) is first tailored for pixel-wise PolSAR
classification task by designing a spiral scan strategy. This strategy
prioritizes causally relevant features near the central pixel, leveraging the
localized nature of pixel-wise classification tasks. Additionally, the
lightweight Cross Mamba module is proposed to facilitates complementary
multi-scale feature interaction with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments
across four benchmark datasets demonstrate ECP-Mamba's effectiveness in
balancing high accuracy with resource efficiency. On the Flevoland 1989
dataset, ECP-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall
accuracy of 99.70%, average accuracy of 99.64% and Kappa coefficient of
99.62e-2. Our code will be available at

Abstract: Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) is a fundamental Low-Level Vision (LLV) task
that synthesizes intermediate frames between existing ones while maintaining
spatial and temporal coherence. VFI techniques have evolved from classical
motion compensation-based approach to deep learning-based approach, including
kernel-, flow-, hybrid-, phase-, GAN-, Transformer-, Mamba-, and more recently
diffusion model-based approach. We introduce AceVFI, the most comprehensive
survey on VFI to date, covering over 250+ papers across these approaches. We
systematically organize and describe VFI methodologies, detailing the core
principles, design assumptions, and technical characteristics of each approach.
We categorize the learning paradigm of VFI methods namely, Center-Time Frame
Interpolation (CTFI) and Arbitrary-Time Frame Interpolation (ATFI). We analyze
key challenges of VFI such as large motion, occlusion, lighting variation, and
non-linear motion. In addition, we review standard datasets, loss functions,
evaluation metrics. We examine applications of VFI including event-based,
cartoon, medical image VFI and joint VFI with other LLV tasks. We conclude by
outlining promising future research directions to support continued progress in
the field. This survey aims to serve as a unified reference for both newcomers
and experts seeking a deep understanding of modern VFI landscapes.

*Yudong Zhang,Ruobing Xie,Yiqing Huang,Jiansheng Chen,Xingwu Sun,Zhanhui Kang,Di Wang,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: F3是一种对抗性净化框架，通过引入噪声来抵消对抗性攻击，提升视觉语言模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）易受视觉对抗攻击影响，但现有净化方法研究较少。

Method: F3采用“以火攻火”策略，通过随机扰动对抗样本并利用跨模态注意力作为参考目标。

Result: F3显著提升了净化效果，且无需训练、实现简单、计算高效。

Conclusion: F3适用于大规模工业应用，兼顾鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have showcased their
remarkable capabilities across a wide range of multimodal vision-language
tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to visual adversarial attacks,
which can substantially compromise their performance. Despite their potential
impact, the development of effective methods for purifying such adversarial
examples has received relatively limited attention. In this paper, we introduce
F3, a novel adversarial purification framework that employs a counterintuitive
"fighting fire with fire" strategy: intentionally introducing simple
perturbations to adversarial examples to mitigate their harmful effects.
Specifically, F3 leverages cross-modal attentions derived from randomly
perturbed adversary examples as reference targets. By injecting noise into
these adversarial examples, F3 effectively refines their attention, resulting
in cleaner and more reliable model outputs. Remarkably, this seemingly
paradoxical approach of employing noise to counteract adversarial attacks
yields impressive purification results. Furthermore, F3 offers several distinct
advantages: it is training-free and straightforward to implement, and exhibits
significant computational efficiency improvements compared to existing
purification methods. These attributes render F3 particularly suitable for
large-scale industrial applications where both robust performance and
operational efficiency are critical priorities. The code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了指纹模式与ABO血型的关系，发现两者关联性较弱，血型数据未能显著提升指纹识别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索低成本、易实施的生物识别方法，以补充现有高成本技术。

Method: 对200名受试者的指纹模式（环、涡、弓）和血型进行统计比较，使用卡方检验和皮尔逊相关性分析。

Result: 环状指纹最常见，O+血型最普遍，但指纹模式与血型无显著统计学关联。

Conclusion: 血型数据对指纹识别的改进作用有限，未来需结合多模态生物特征和机器学习以提升识别效果。

Abstract: Identification of a person is central in forensic science, security, and
healthcare. Methods such as iris scanning and genomic profiling are more
accurate but expensive, time-consuming, and more difficult to implement. This
study focuses on the relationship between the fingerprint patterns and the ABO
blood group as a biometric identification tool. A total of 200 subjects were
included in the study, and fingerprint types (loops, whorls, and arches) and
blood groups were compared. Associations were evaluated with statistical tests,
including chi-square and Pearson correlation. The study found that the loops
were the most common fingerprint pattern and the O+ blood group was the most
prevalent. Even though there was some associative pattern, there was no
statistically significant difference in the fingerprint patterns of different
blood groups. Overall, the results indicate that blood group data do not
significantly improve personal identification when used in conjunction with
fingerprinting. Although the study shows weak correlation, it may emphasize the
efforts of multi-modal based biometric systems in enhancing the current
biometric systems. Future studies may focus on larger and more diverse samples,
and possibly machine learning and additional biometrics to improve
identification methods. This study addresses an element of the ever-changing
nature of the fields of forensic science and biometric identification,
highlighting the importance of resilient analytical methods for personal
identification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视图训练虽能提升性能，但对比学习在视图增加时未能持续增强模型泛化能力，需解决梯度冲突和不平衡问题。

Method: 通过理论梯度分析，设计ACL算法以消除正负对之间的梯度冲突和不平衡问题。

Result: 在多个数据集上（如长尾CIFAR、ImageNet等）ACL实现了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: ACL算法有效解决了长尾识别问题，并在实验中表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an Aligned Contrastive Learning (ACL) algorithm to
address the long-tailed recognition problem. Our findings indicate that while
multi-view training boosts the performance, contrastive learning does not
consistently enhance model generalization as the number of views increases.
Through theoretical gradient analysis of supervised contrastive learning (SCL),
we identify gradient conflicts, and imbalanced attraction and repulsion
gradients between positive and negative pairs as the underlying issues. Our ACL
algorithm is designed to eliminate these problems and demonstrates strong
performance across multiple benchmarks. We validate the effectiveness of ACL
through experiments on long-tailed CIFAR, ImageNet, Places, and iNaturalist
datasets. Results show that ACL achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于解剖学变异性、CT成像中软组织对比度低以及标注数据集有限，准确分割CTV和风险器官具有挑战性。

Method: GynBTNet采用三阶段训练策略：自监督预训练、监督微调和任务特定微调，使用DSC、HD95和ASD进行评估。

Result: GynBTNet在DSC、HD95和ASD指标上显著优于nnU-Net和Swin-UNETR，但对乙状结肠的分割仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: GynBTNet通过自监督预训练提升了分割性能，尤其对复杂边界结构效果显著，但需进一步优化乙状结肠的分割。

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate segmentation of clinical target volumes (CTV) and
organs-at-risk is crucial for optimizing gynecologic brachytherapy (GYN-BT)
treatment planning. However, anatomical variability, low soft-tissue contrast
in CT imaging, and limited annotated datasets pose significant challenges. This
study presents GynBTNet, a novel multi-stage learning framework designed to
enhance segmentation performance through self-supervised pretraining and
hierarchical fine-tuning strategies. Methods: GynBTNet employs a three-stage
training strategy: (1) self-supervised pretraining on large-scale CT datasets
using sparse submanifold convolution to capture robust anatomical
representations, (2) supervised fine-tuning on a comprehensive multi-organ
segmentation dataset to refine feature extraction, and (3) task-specific
fine-tuning on a dedicated GYN-BT dataset to optimize segmentation performance
for clinical applications. The model was evaluated against state-of-the-art
methods using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), 95th percentile Hausdorff
Distance (HD95), and Average Surface Distance (ASD). Results: Our GynBTNet
achieved superior segmentation performance, significantly outperforming nnU-Net
and Swin-UNETR. Notably, it yielded a DSC of 0.837 +/- 0.068 for CTV, 0.940 +/-
0.052 for the bladder, 0.842 +/- 0.070 for the rectum, and 0.871 +/- 0.047 for
the uterus, with reduced HD95 and ASD compared to baseline models.
Self-supervised pretraining led to consistent performance improvements,
particularly for structures with complex boundaries. However, segmentation of
the sigmoid colon remained challenging, likely due to anatomical ambiguities
and inter-patient variability. Statistical significance analysis confirmed that
GynBTNet's improvements were significant compared to baseline models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在视觉中心任务中表现不佳，主要依赖逻辑和知识推理，未能有效整合视觉信息。

Method: 提出Cue-Rethinking方法，结合两阶段训练流程（冷启动和强化学习），并构建GThinker-11K数据集。

Result: 在M$^3$CoT基准测试中达到81.5%，通用场景任务平均提升2.1%，数学推理表现持平。

Conclusion: GThinker在多模态推理任务中表现优异，填补了通用多模态推理的数据空白。

Abstract: Despite notable advancements in multimodal reasoning, leading Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) still underperform on vision-centric multimodal
reasoning tasks in general scenarios. This shortfall stems from their
predominant reliance on logic- and knowledge-based slow thinking strategies,
while effective for domains like math and science, fail to integrate visual
information effectively during reasoning. Consequently, these models often fail
to adequately ground visual cues, resulting in suboptimal performance in tasks
that require multiple plausible visual interpretations and inferences. To
address this, we present GThinker (General Thinker), a novel reasoning MLLM
excelling in multimodal reasoning across general scenarios, mathematics, and
science. GThinker introduces Cue-Rethinking, a flexible reasoning pattern that
grounds inferences in visual cues and iteratively reinterprets these cues to
resolve inconsistencies. Building on this pattern, we further propose a
two-stage training pipeline, including pattern-guided cold start and incentive
reinforcement learning, designed to enable multimodal reasoning capabilities
across domains. Furthermore, to support the training, we construct
GThinker-11K, comprising 7K high-quality, iteratively-annotated reasoning paths
and 4K curated reinforcement learning samples, filling the data gap toward
general multimodal reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GThinker
achieves 81.5% on the challenging comprehensive multimodal reasoning benchmark
M$^3$CoT, surpassing the latest O4-mini model. It also shows an average
improvement of 2.1% on general scenario multimodal reasoning benchmarks, while
maintaining on-par performance in mathematical reasoning compared to
counterpart advanced reasoning models. The code, model, and data will be
released soon at https://github.com/jefferyZhan/GThinker.

TL;DR: PROGRESS是一种高效的数据和计算框架，通过动态选择学习样本优化视觉语言模型的训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指令调优方法需要大量数据和计算资源，PROGRESS旨在减少这些需求。

Method: 模型根据学习进度动态选择未掌握且难度适中的样本，优先学习进步最快的技能。

Result: PROGRESS在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，且数据需求和监督更少。

Conclusion: PROGRESS是一种可扩展的高效学习解决方案，适用于不同规模的模型。

Abstract: Instruction tuning has been central to the success of recent vision-language
models (VLMs), but it remains expensive-requiring large-scale datasets,
high-quality annotations, and large compute budgets. We propose PRioritized
cOncept learninG via Relative Error-driven Sample Selection (PROGRESS), a data-
and compute-efficient framework that enables VLMs to dynamically select what to
learn next based on their evolving needs during training. At each stage, the
model tracks its learning progress across skills and selects the most
informative samples-those it has not already mastered and that are not too
difficult to learn at the current stage of training. This strategy effectively
controls skill acquisition and the order in which skills are learned.
Specifically, we sample from skills showing the highest learning progress,
prioritizing those with the most rapid improvement. Unlike prior methods,
PROGRESS requires no upfront answer annotations, queries answers only on a need
basis, avoids reliance on additional supervision from auxiliary VLMs, and does
not require compute-heavy gradient computations for data selection. Experiments
across multiple instruction-tuning datasets of varying scales demonstrate that
PROGRESS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with much less
data and supervision. Additionally, we show strong cross-architecture
generalization and transferability to larger models, validating PROGRESS as a
scalable solution for efficient learning.

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过合理选择，视觉令牌可以在LLM输入阶段压缩，性能损失可忽略。利用可解释性方法评估令牌重要性，并提出一种轻量级卷积网络学习映射，实现高效压缩。实验证明，压缩50%令牌仍能保留96%以上性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs处理大量视觉令牌导致计算成本高且效率低，传统方法假设浅层需所有令牌，压缩通常在中间层进行。本研究挑战这一假设，探索输入阶段压缩的可能性。

Method: 利用可解释性方法评估视觉令牌重要性，提出轻量级卷积网络学习从第一层注意力映射到解释结果的映射，避免完整推理。

Result: 在10个图像和视频基准测试中，压缩50%令牌仍保留96%以上性能，且方法具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 输入阶段令牌压缩可行且高效，轻量级网络实现快速部署，为MLLMs优化提供新思路。

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process a large number of
visual tokens, leading to significant computational costs and inefficiency.
Previous works generally assume that all visual tokens are necessary in the
shallow layers of LLMs, and therefore token compression typically occurs in
intermediate layers. In contrast, our study reveals an interesting insight:
with proper selection, token compression is feasible at the input stage of LLM
with negligible performance loss. Specifically, we reveal that explainability
methods can effectively evaluate the importance of each visual token with
respect to the given instruction, which can well guide the token compression.
Furthermore, we propose to learn a mapping from the attention map of the first
LLM layer to the explanation results, thereby avoiding the need for a full
inference pass and facilitating practical deployment. Interestingly, this
mapping can be learned using a simple and lightweight convolutional network,
whose training is efficient and independent of MLLMs. Extensive experiments on
10 image and video benchmarks across three leading MLLMs (Qwen2-VL,
LLaVA-OneVision, and VILA1.5) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
e.g., pruning 50% visual tokens while retaining more than 96% of the original
performance across all benchmarks for all these three MLLMs. It also exhibits
strong generalization, even when the number of tokens in inference far exceeds
that used in training.

Abstract: We pose keystep recognition as a node classification task, and propose a
flexible graph-learning framework for fine-grained keystep recognition that is
able to effectively leverage long-term dependencies in egocentric videos. Our
approach, termed GLEVR, consists of constructing a graph where each video clip
of the egocentric video corresponds to a node. The constructed graphs are
sparse and computationally efficient, outperforming existing larger models
substantially. We further leverage alignment between egocentric and exocentric
videos during training for improved inference on egocentric videos, as well as
adding automatic captioning as an additional modality. We consider each clip of
each exocentric video (if available) or video captions as additional nodes
during training. We examine several strategies to define connections across
these nodes. We perform extensive experiments on the Ego-Exo4D dataset and show
that our proposed flexible graph-based framework notably outperforms existing
methods.

Motivation: 现有交互模型主要预测视觉观测，忽略了几何结构和空间一致性等隐藏状态，导致误差积累和时间不一致。

Method: DeepVerse将前一时间步的几何预测显式结合到当前动作条件下的预测中，引入几何约束。

Result: 实验表明，DeepVerse能捕捉更丰富的时空关系和物理动态，显著减少漂移并增强时间一致性。

Conclusion: DeepVerse在几何感知动态基础上实现了高保真、长时程预测，为几何感知记忆检索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: World models serve as essential building blocks toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), enabling intelligent agents to predict future states and
plan actions by simulating complex physical interactions. However, existing
interactive models primarily predict visual observations, thereby neglecting
crucial hidden states like geometric structures and spatial coherence. This
leads to rapid error accumulation and temporal inconsistency. To address these
limitations, we introduce DeepVerse, a novel 4D interactive world model
explicitly incorporating geometric predictions from previous timesteps into
current predictions conditioned on actions. Experiments demonstrate that by
incorporating explicit geometric constraints, DeepVerse captures richer
spatio-temporal relationships and underlying physical dynamics. This capability
significantly reduces drift and enhances temporal consistency, enabling the
model to reliably generate extended future sequences and achieve substantial
improvements in prediction accuracy, visual realism, and scene rationality.
Furthermore, our method provides an effective solution for geometry-aware
memory retrieval, effectively preserving long-term spatial consistency. We
validate the effectiveness of DeepVerse across diverse scenarios, establishing
its capacity for high-fidelity, long-horizon predictions grounded in
geometry-aware dynamics.

TL;DR: FruitLangGS是一个实时3D水果计数框架，通过空间重建、语义嵌入和语言引导的实例估计，解决了现有方法在推理速度、泛化能力和语义控制方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决农业环境中水果计数的挑战，如视觉遮挡、语义模糊和3D重建的高计算需求。

Method: 采用自适应高斯溅射管道进行场景重建，结合CLIP对齐的语言嵌入实现语义控制，并通过分布感知采样和聚类估计水果数量。

Result: 在真实果园数据上，FruitLangGS在渲染速度、语义灵活性和计数准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FruitLangGS为开放世界场景中的语言驱动实时神经渲染提供了新视角。

Abstract: Accurate fruit counting in real-world agricultural environments is a
longstanding challenge due to visual occlusions, semantic ambiguity, and the
high computational demands of 3D reconstruction. Existing methods based on
neural radiance fields suffer from low inference speed, limited generalization,
and lack support for open-set semantic control. This paper presents
FruitLangGS, a real-time 3D fruit counting framework that addresses these
limitations through spatial reconstruction, semantic embedding, and
language-guided instance estimation. FruitLangGS first reconstructs
orchard-scale scenes using an adaptive Gaussian splatting pipeline with
radius-aware pruning and tile-based rasterization for efficient rendering. To
enable semantic control, each Gaussian encodes a compressed CLIP-aligned
language embedding, forming a compact and queryable 3D representation. At
inference time, prompt-based semantic filtering is applied directly in 3D
space, without relying on image-space segmentation or view-level fusion. The
selected Gaussians are then converted into dense point clouds via
distribution-aware sampling and clustered to estimate fruit counts.
Experimental results on real orchard data demonstrate that FruitLangGS achieves
higher rendering speed, semantic flexibility, and counting accuracy compared to
prior approaches, offering a new perspective for language-driven, real-time
neural rendering across open-world scenarios.

TL;DR: MOOSE是一种新型视频编码器，通过结合光流和空间嵌入来高效建模时间信息，减少计算复杂度并提升时间可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多视频分析任务需要高效且可解释的时间建模，但现有方法通常计算资源密集且依赖精细标注。

Method: MOOSE利用预训练的视觉和光流编码器，结合光流与空间嵌入，设计了一种高效的时间中心架构。

Result: MOOSE在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，包括临床、医学和动作识别数据集。

Conclusion: MOOSE提供了一种高效且可解释的时间建模方法，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Many motion-centric video analysis tasks, such as atomic actions, detecting
atypical motor behavior in individuals with autism, or analyzing articulatory
motion in real-time MRI of human speech, require efficient and interpretable
temporal modeling. Capturing temporal dynamics is a central challenge in video
analysis, often requiring significant computational resources and fine-grained
annotations that are not widely available. This paper presents MOOSE (Motion
Flow Over Spatial Space), a novel temporally-centric video encoder explicitly
integrating optical flow with spatial embeddings to model temporal information
efficiently, inspired by human perception of motion. Unlike prior models, MOOSE
takes advantage of rich, widely available pre-trained visual and optical flow
encoders instead of training video models from scratch. This significantly
reduces computational complexity while enhancing temporal interpretability. Our
primary contributions includes (1) proposing a computationally efficient
temporally-centric architecture for video understanding (2) demonstrating
enhanced interpretability in modeling temporal dynamics; and (3) achieving
state-of-the-art performance on diverse benchmarks, including clinical,
medical, and standard action recognition datasets, confirming the broad
applicability and effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集（如CholecT50）存在空间标注不精确、时间标签不一致且缺乏临床依据、数据来源单一等问题，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 通过机器人辅助前列腺切除术领域，开发了ProstaTD数据集，提供临床定义的时间边界和高精度空间标注，包含60,529帧视频和165,567个标注实例。

Result: ProstaTD是目前最大且最多样化的手术三重检测数据集，支持公平基准测试和可靠手术AI系统的开发。

Conclusion: ProstaTD为手术视频分析提供了强大的数据基础，有助于提升手术培训和AI系统的性能。

Abstract: Surgical triplet detection has emerged as a pivotal task in surgical video
analysis, with significant implications for performance assessment and the
training of novice surgeons. However, existing datasets such as CholecT50
exhibit critical limitations: they lack precise spatial bounding box
annotations, provide inconsistent and clinically ungrounded temporal labels,
and rely on a single data source, which limits model generalizability.To
address these shortcomings, we introduce ProstaTD, a large-scale,
multi-institutional dataset for surgical triplet detection, developed from the
technically demanding domain of robot-assisted prostatectomy. ProstaTD offers
clinically defined temporal boundaries and high-precision bounding box
annotations for each structured triplet action. The dataset comprises 60,529
video frames and 165,567 annotated triplet instances, collected from 21
surgeries performed across multiple institutions, reflecting a broad range of
surgical practices and intraoperative conditions. The annotation process was
conducted under rigorous medical supervision and involved more than 50
contributors, including practicing surgeons and medically trained annotators,
through multiple iterative phases of labeling and verification. ProstaTD is the
largest and most diverse surgical triplet dataset to date, providing a robust
foundation for fair benchmarking, the development of reliable surgical AI
systems, and scalable tools for procedural training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频扩散模型在时间建模（如运动、物理和动态交互）方面存在局限，通常需要重新训练或引入外部条件信号。

Method: FlowMo通过测量连续帧潜在表示的距离，提取时间表示，并通过动态调整采样过程中的方差来增强运动一致性。

Result: 实验表明，FlowMo显著提高了运动一致性，同时保持了视觉质量和提示对齐。

Conclusion: FlowMo为预训练视频扩散模型提供了一种即插即用的时间保真度增强方案。

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models are notoriously limited in their ability to
model temporal aspects such as motion, physics, and dynamic interactions.
Existing approaches address this limitation by retraining the model or
introducing external conditioning signals to enforce temporal consistency. In
this work, we explore whether a meaningful temporal representation can be
extracted directly from the predictions of a pre-trained model without any
additional training or auxiliary inputs. We introduce \textbf{FlowMo}, a novel
training-free guidance method that enhances motion coherence using only the
model's own predictions in each diffusion step. FlowMo first derives an
appearance-debiased temporal representation by measuring the distance between
latents corresponding to consecutive frames. This highlights the implicit
temporal structure predicted by the model. It then estimates motion coherence
by measuring the patch-wise variance across the temporal dimension and guides
the model to reduce this variance dynamically during sampling. Extensive
experiments across multiple text-to-video models demonstrate that FlowMo
significantly improves motion coherence without sacrificing visual quality or
prompt alignment, offering an effective plug-and-play solution for enhancing
the temporal fidelity of pre-trained video diffusion models.

Result: 在多种形状数据集上表现优异，性能接近SOTA，同时显著减少可训练参数。

Conclusion: SVarM为形状分析提供了一种高效且通用的框架，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Despite progress in the rapidly developing field of geometric deep learning,
performing statistical analysis on geometric data--where each observation is a
shape such as a curve, graph, or surface--remains challenging due to the
non-Euclidean nature of shape spaces, which are defined as equivalence classes
under invariance groups. Building machine learning frameworks that incorporate
such invariances, notably to shape parametrization, is often crucial to ensure
generalizability of the trained models to new observations. This work proposes
SVarM to exploit varifold representations of shapes as measures and their
duality with test functions $h:\mathbb{R}^n \times S^{n-1} \to \mathbb{R}$.
This method provides a general framework akin to linear support vector machines
but operating instead over the infinite-dimensional space of varifolds. We
develop classification and regression models on shape datasets by introducing a
neural network-based representation of the trainable test function $h$. This
approach demonstrates strong performance and robustness across various shape
graph and surface datasets, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art
methods while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比表示学习框架直接学习语义表示空间，忽略了视觉的多阶段处理特性，导致收敛慢和纹理偏差。

Method: 利用Marr的多阶段理论，先构建边界和表面级表示，再训练语义表示。

Result: 在ResNet18上实现2倍收敛速度提升，并在语义分割、深度估计和物体识别任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 提出在对比表示预训练前增加预训练阶段，利用人类视觉系统的归纳偏置提升最终表示质量和收敛效率。

Abstract: David Marr's seminal theory of human perception stipulates that visual
processing is a multi-stage process, prioritizing the derivation of boundary
and surface properties before forming semantic object representations. In
contrast, contrastive representation learning frameworks typically bypass this
explicit multi-stage approach, defining their objective as the direct learning
of a semantic representation space for objects. While effective in general
contexts, this approach sacrifices the inductive biases of vision, leading to
slower convergence speed and learning shortcut resulting in texture bias. In
this work, we demonstrate that leveraging Marr's multi-stage theory-by first
constructing boundary and surface-level representations using perceptual
constructs from early visual processing stages and subsequently training for
object semantics-leads to 2x faster convergence on ResNet18, improved final
representations on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and object
recognition, and enhanced robustness and out-of-distribution capability.
Together, we propose a pretraining stage before the general contrastive
representation pretraining to further enhance the final representation quality
and reduce the overall convergence time via inductive bias from human vision
systems.

Conclusion: SMILE-VLM提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，优于无监督方法并匹配或超越有监督基线。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a fundamental task in affective
computing with applications in human-computer interaction, mental health
analysis, and behavioral understanding. In this paper, we propose SMILE-VLM, a
self-supervised vision-language model for 3D/4D FER that unifies multiview
visual representation learning with natural language supervision. SMILE-VLM
learns robust, semantically aligned, and view-invariant embeddings by proposing
three core components: multiview decorrelation via a Barlow Twins-style loss,
vision-language contrastive alignment, and cross-modal redundancy minimization.
Our framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.
We further extend SMILE-VLM to the task of 4D micro-expression recognition
(MER) to recognize the subtle affective cues. The extensive results demonstrate
that SMILE-VLM not only surpasses existing unsupervised methods but also
matches or exceeds supervised baselines, offering a scalable and
annotation-efficient solution for expressive facial behavior understanding.

Abstract: This review provides an in-depth exploration of the field of animal action
recognition, focusing on coarse-grained (CG) and fine-grained (FG) techniques.
The primary aim is to examine the current state of research in animal behaviour
recognition and to elucidate the unique challenges associated with recognising
subtle animal actions in outdoor environments. These challenges differ
significantly from those encountered in human action recognition due to factors
such as non-rigid body structures, frequent occlusions, and the lack of
large-scale, annotated datasets. The review begins by discussing the evolution
of human action recognition, a more established field, highlighting how it
progressed from broad, coarse actions in controlled settings to the demand for
fine-grained recognition in dynamic environments. This shift is particularly
relevant for animal action recognition, where behavioural variability and
environmental complexity present unique challenges that human-centric models
cannot fully address. The review then underscores the critical differences
between human and animal action recognition, with an emphasis on high
intra-species variability, unstructured datasets, and the natural complexity of
animal habitats. Techniques like spatio-temporal deep learning frameworks
(e.g., SlowFast) are evaluated for their effectiveness in animal behaviour
analysis, along with the limitations of existing datasets. By assessing the
strengths and weaknesses of current methodologies and introducing a
recently-published dataset, the review outlines future directions for advancing
fine-grained action recognition, aiming to improve accuracy and
generalisability in behaviour analysis across species.

Method: 利用GAN判别器训练单类模型，通过置信度分数阈值识别错误标签和修改图像。

Result: 训练后的判别器能100%识别测试中的毒化图像，扰动幅度阈值从0.20开始。

Conclusion: 开发者可基于此方法训练判别器，保护高价值类别的CV模型。

Abstract: Gathering enough images to train a deep computer vision model is a constant
challenge. Unfortunately, collecting images from unknown sources can leave your
model s behavior at risk of being manipulated by a dirty-label or clean-label
attack unless the images are properly inspected. Manually inspecting each
image-label pair is impractical and common poison-detection methods that
involve re-training your model can be time consuming. This research uses GAN
discriminators to protect a single class against mislabeled and different
levels of modified images. The effect of said perturbation on a basic
convolutional neural network classifier is also included for reference. The
results suggest that after training on a single class, GAN discriminator s
confidence scores can provide a threshold to identify mislabeled images and
identify 100% of the tested poison starting at a perturbation epsilon magnitude
of 0.20, after decision threshold calibration using in-class samples.
Developers can use this report as a basis to train their own discriminators to
protect high valued classes in their CV models.

Conclusion: 稀疏特征引导能显著提升特定类别的性能，原型对齐进一步优化稀疏特征与下游任务的相关性。

Abstract: Steering vision foundation models at inference time without retraining or
access to large labeled datasets is a desirable yet challenging objective,
particularly in dynamic or resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we
introduce Visual Sparse Steering (VS2), a lightweight, test-time method that
guides vision models using steering vectors derived from sparse features
learned by top-$k$ Sparse Autoencoders without requiring contrastive data.
Specifically, VS2 surpasses zero-shot CLIP by 4.12% on CIFAR-100, 1.08% on
CUB-200, and 1.84% on Tiny-ImageNet. We further propose VS2++, a
retrieval-augmented variant that selectively amplifies relevant sparse features
using pseudo-labeled neighbors at inference time. With oracle positive/negative
sets, VS2++ achieves absolute top-1 gains over CLIP zero-shot of up to 21.44%
on CIFAR-100, 7.08% on CUB-200, and 20.47% on Tiny-ImageNet. Interestingly, VS2
and VS2++ raise per-class accuracy by up to 25% and 38%, respectively, showing
that sparse steering benefits specific classes by disambiguating visually or
taxonomically proximate categories rather than providing a uniform boost.
Finally, to better align the sparse features learned through the SAE
reconstruction task with those relevant for downstream performance, we propose
Prototype-Aligned Sparse Steering (PASS). By incorporating a
prototype-alignment loss during SAE training, using labels only during training
while remaining fully test-time unsupervised, PASS consistently, though
modestly, outperforms VS2, achieving a 6.12% gain over VS2 only on CIFAR-100
with ViT-B/32.

Motivation: 现有视频多模态模型在帧选择上依赖静态启发式方法或外部检索模块，无法有效提供查询相关信息。

Result: 在多个视频问答基准测试中显著提升了推理性能。

Conclusion: 通过将帧选择与模型内部效用对齐，ReFoCUS展示了无需显式监督即可改进视频理解的能力。

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) has enabled effective
vision-language reasoning, yet the ability to understand video content remains
constrained by suboptimal frame selection strategies. Existing approaches often
rely on static heuristics or external retrieval modules to feed frame
information into video-LLMs, which may fail to provide the query-relevant
information. In this work, we introduce ReFoCUS (Reinforcement-guided Frame
Optimization for Contextual UnderStanding), a novel frame-level policy
optimization framework that shifts the optimization target from textual
responses to visual input selection. ReFoCUS learns a frame selection policy
via reinforcement learning, using reward signals derived from a reference LMM
to reflect the model's intrinsic preferences for frames that best support
temporally grounded responses. To efficiently explore the large combinatorial
frame space, we employ an autoregressive, conditional selection architecture
that ensures temporal coherence while reducing complexity. Our approach does
not require explicit supervision at the frame-level and consistently improves
reasoning performance across multiple video QA benchmarks, highlighting the
benefits of aligning frame selection with model-internal utility.

Motivation: 现有评估基准忽视了MLLMs对结构化视觉知识的理解能力，作者希望通过M3STR填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了基于多模态知识图谱的M3STR基准，要求模型识别多模态实体并解析其复杂关系拓扑。

Result: 对26个先进MLLMs的评估显示，它们在处理结构化视觉知识时仍存在显著不足。

Conclusion: M3STR为提升MLLMs的整体推理能力提供了关键方向，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) incorporate heterogeneous
modalities into LLMs, enabling a comprehensive understanding of diverse
scenarios and objects. Despite the proliferation of evaluation benchmarks and
leaderboards for MLLMs, they predominantly overlook the critical capacity of
MLLMs to comprehend world knowledge with structured abstractions that appear in
visual form. To address this gap, we propose a novel evaluation paradigm and
devise M3STR, an innovative benchmark grounded in the Multi-Modal Map for
STRuctured understanding. This benchmark leverages multi-modal knowledge graphs
to synthesize images encapsulating subgraph architectures enriched with
multi-modal entities. M3STR necessitates that MLLMs not only recognize the
multi-modal entities within the visual inputs but also decipher intricate
relational topologies among them. We delineate the benchmark's statistical
profiles and automated construction pipeline, accompanied by an extensive
empirical analysis of 26 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our findings reveal persistent
deficiencies in processing abstractive visual information with structured
knowledge, thereby charting a pivotal trajectory for advancing MLLMs' holistic
reasoning capacities. Our code and data are released at

Conclusion: ReAgent-V是一种轻量级、模块化且可扩展的框架，显著提升了视频理解的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Video understanding is fundamental to tasks such as action recognition, video
reasoning, and robotic control. Early video understanding methods based on
large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically adopt a single-pass reasoning
paradigm without dynamic feedback, limiting the model's capacity to
self-correct and adapt in complex scenarios. Recent efforts have attempted to
address this limitation by incorporating reward models and reinforcement
learning to enhance reasoning, or by employing tool-agent frameworks. However,
these approaches face several challenges, including high annotation costs,
reward signals that fail to capture real-time reasoning states, and low
inference efficiency. To overcome these issues, we propose ReAgent-V, a novel
agentic video understanding framework that integrates efficient frame selection
with real-time reward generation during inference. These reward signals not
only guide iterative answer refinement through a multi-perspective reflection
mechanism-adjusting predictions from conservative, neutral, and aggressive
viewpoints-but also enable automatic filtering of high-quality data for
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), direct preference optimization (DPO), and group
relative policy optimization (GRPO). ReAgent-V is lightweight, modular, and
extensible, supporting flexible tool integration tailored to diverse tasks.
Extensive experiments on 12 datasets across three core applications-video
understanding, video reasoning enhancement, and vision-language-action model
alignment-demonstrate significant gains in generalization and reasoning, with
improvements of up to 6.9%, 2.1%, and 9.8%, respectively, highlighting the

TL;DR: SAM-I2V是一种高效的图像到视频升级方法，通过预训练的SAM模型实现提示式视频分割，显著降低训练成本和资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展基础模型（如SAM）到视频领域面临挑战，尤其是动态场景中精确且时间一致的掩码传播。

Method: 引入三个关键创新：图像到视频特征提取升级器、内存过滤策略和内存作为提示机制。

Result: 实验表明，SAM-I2V达到SAM 2性能的90%以上，仅需0.2%的训练成本。

Conclusion: SAM-I2V为提示式视频分割提供了资源高效的解决方案，降低了研究门槛并推动领域发展。

Abstract: Foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have significantly
advanced promptable image segmentation in computer vision. However, extending
these capabilities to videos presents substantial challenges, particularly in
ensuring precise and temporally consistent mask propagation in dynamic scenes.
SAM 2 attempts to address this by training a model on massive image and video
data from scratch to learn complex spatiotemporal associations, resulting in
huge training costs that hinder research and practical deployment. In this
paper, we introduce SAM-I2V, an effective image-to-video upgradation method for
cultivating a promptable video segmentation (PVS) model. Our approach
strategically upgrades the pre-trained SAM to support PVS, significantly
reducing training complexity and resource requirements. To achieve this, we
introduce three key innovations: (i) an image-to-video feature extraction
upgrader built upon SAM's static image encoder to enable spatiotemporal video
perception, (ii) a memory filtering strategy that selects the most relevant
past frames for more effective utilization of historical information, and (iii)
a memory-as-prompt mechanism leveraging object memory to ensure temporally
consistent mask propagation in dynamic scenes. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves over 90% of SAM 2's performance while
using only 0.2% of its training cost. Our work presents a resource-efficient
pathway to PVS, lowering barriers for further research in PVS model design and
enabling broader applications and advancements in the field. Code and model are

Conclusion: 提出的数据集、框架和指标为超高清图像合成提供了全面解决方案。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution image synthesis holds significant potential, yet
remains an underexplored challenge due to the absence of standardized
benchmarks and computational constraints. In this paper, we establish
Aesthetic-4K, a meticulously curated dataset containing dedicated training and
evaluation subsets specifically designed for comprehensive research on
ultra-high-resolution image synthesis. This dataset consists of high-quality 4K
images accompanied by descriptive captions generated by GPT-4o. Furthermore, we
propose Diffusion-4K, an innovative framework for the direct generation of
ultra-high-resolution images. Our approach incorporates the Scale Consistent
Variational Auto-Encoder (SC-VAE) and Wavelet-based Latent Fine-tuning (WLF),
which are designed for efficient visual token compression and the capture of
intricate details in ultra-high-resolution images, thereby facilitating direct
training with photorealistic 4K data. This method is applicable to various
latent diffusion models and demonstrates its efficacy in synthesizing highly
detailed 4K images. Additionally, we propose novel metrics, namely the GLCM
Score and Compression Ratio, to assess the texture richness and fine details in
local patches, in conjunction with holistic measures such as FID, Aesthetics,
and CLIPScore, enabling a thorough and multifaceted evaluation of
ultra-high-resolution image synthesis. Consequently, Diffusion-4K achieves
impressive performance in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis, particularly
when powered by state-of-the-art large-scale diffusion models (eg, Flux-12B).

Abstract: We aim to detect the class and orientation of a vehicle by training a model
with synthetic data. However, the distribution of the classes in the training
data is imbalanced, and the model trained on the synthetic image is difficult
to predict in real-world images. We propose a two-stage detection model with
photo-realistic image generation to tackle this issue. Our model mainly takes
four steps to detect the class and orientation of the vehicle. (1) It builds a
table containing the image, class, and location information of objects in the
image, (2) transforms the synthetic images into real-world images style, and
merges them into the meta table. (3) Classify vehicle class and orientation
using images from the meta-table. (4) Finally, the vehicle class and
orientation are detected by combining the pre-extracted location information
and the predicted classes. We achieved 4th place in IEEE BigData Challenge 2022
Vehicle class and Orientation Detection (VOD) with our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文重新思考了图像直方图匹配（HM），并提出了一种可微分且参数化的HM预处理方法，用于下游分类器。通过优化目标像素值分布，该方法在恶劣天气条件下提升了分类器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卷积神经网络在分类任务中表现优异，但在低对比度图像（如恶劣天气条件下拍摄的图像）上性能下降。传统直方图均衡化（HE）是HM的一种特例，但其目标分布固定为均匀分布。本文假设，设计一个优化的目标分布可能进一步提升分类器性能。

Method: 提出了一种可微分且参数化的HM方法，通过下游分类器的损失函数优化目标像素值分布。该方法仅使用正常天气图像进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用本文提出的HM预处理的分类器在恶劣天气条件下优于传统预处理方法。

Conclusion: 通过优化目标像素值分布，可微分且参数化的HM有效提升了分类器在恶劣天气条件下的性能。

Abstract: This paper rethinks image histogram matching (HM) and proposes a
differentiable and parametric HM preprocessing for a downstream classifier.
Convolutional neural networks have demonstrated remarkable achievements in
classification tasks. However, they often exhibit degraded performance on
low-contrast images captured under adverse weather conditions. To maintain
classifier performance under low-contrast images, histogram equalization (HE)
is commonly used. HE is a special case of HM using a uniform distribution as a
target pixel value distribution. In this paper, we focus on the shape of the
target pixel value distribution. Compared to a uniform distribution, a single,
well-designed distribution could have potential to improve the performance of
the downstream classifier across various adverse weather conditions. Based on
this hypothesis, we propose a differentiable and parametric HM that optimizes
the target distribution using the loss function of the downstream classifier.
This method addresses pixel value imbalances by transforming input images with
arbitrary distributions into a target distribution optimized for the
classifier. Our HM is trained on only normal weather images using the
classifier. Experimental results show that a classifier trained with our
proposed HM outperforms conventional preprocessing methods under adverse
weather conditions.

### [438] [Target Driven Adaptive Loss For Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01349)
*Yuho Shoji,Takahiro Toizumi,Atsushi Ito*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种目标驱动的自适应（TDA）损失函数，用于提升红外小目标检测（IRSTD）的性能，解决了现有损失函数在局部区域检测和小尺度、低对比度目标上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有损失函数（如二元交叉熵损失和IoU损失）在训练分割模型时，虽然能提取像素级特征或全局图像上下文，但无法有效提升局部目标区域的检测性能，以及对小尺度和低对比度目标的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出TDA损失，引入基于块的机制和自适应调整策略，针对目标的尺度和局部对比度进行优化，使模型更关注目标周围的局部区域，尤其是小尺度和低对比度目标。

Result: 在三个IRSTD数据集上的实验表明，TDA损失比现有损失函数具有更好的检测性能。

Conclusion: TDA损失通过优化局部区域和小尺度目标的检测，显著提升了IRSTD任务的性能。

Abstract: We propose a target driven adaptive (TDA) loss to enhance the performance of
infrared small target detection (IRSTD). Prior works have used loss functions,
such as binary cross-entropy loss and IoU loss, to train segmentation models
for IRSTD. Minimizing these loss functions guides models to extract pixel-level
features or global image context. However, they have two issues: improving
detection performance for local regions around the targets and enhancing
robustness to small scale and low local contrast. To address these issues, the
proposed TDA loss introduces a patch-based mechanism, and an adaptive
adjustment strategy to scale and local contrast. The proposed TDA loss leads
the model to focus on local regions around the targets and pay particular
attention to targets with smaller scales and lower local contrast. We evaluate
the proposed method on three datasets for IRSTD. The results demonstrate that
the proposed TDA loss achieves better detection performance than existing
losses on these datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CLIP的雨感知网络（CLIP-RPN），通过视觉-语言匹配分数自适应路由到子网络处理不同雨模式，结合MGCA和DLS机制，显著提升了去雨效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去雨模型使用单一网络处理所有雨图像，但雨模式差异大，单一网络难以应对多样性。

Method: 利用CLIP的跨模态对齐能力识别雨模式，动态激活子网络；引入MGCA机制预测多尺度雨掩码，使用DLS机制优化训练。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到最优性能，尤其在复杂混合数据集中表现突出。

Conclusion: CLIP-RPN通过自适应路由和动态优化，有效提升了去雨模型的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Existing deraining models process all rainy images within a single network.
However, different rain patterns have significant variations, which makes it
challenging for a single network to handle diverse types of raindrops and
streaks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CLIP-driven rain
perception network (CLIP-RPN) that leverages CLIP to automatically perceive
rain patterns by computing visual-language matching scores and adaptively
routing to sub-networks to handle different rain patterns, such as varying
raindrop densities, streak orientations, and rainfall intensity. CLIP-RPN
establishes semantic-aware rain pattern recognition through CLIP's cross-modal
visual-language alignment capabilities, enabling automatic identification of
precipitation characteristics across different rain scenarios. This rain
pattern awareness drives an adaptive subnetwork routing mechanism where
specialized processing branches are dynamically activated based on the detected
rain type, significantly enhancing the model's capacity to handle diverse
rainfall conditions. Furthermore, within sub-networks of CLIP-RPN, we introduce
a mask-guided cross-attention mechanism (MGCA) that predicts precise rain masks
at multi-scale to facilitate contextual interactions between rainy regions and
clean background areas by cross-attention. We also introduces a dynamic loss
scheduling mechanism (DLS) to adaptively adjust the gradients for the
optimization process of CLIP-RPN. Compared with the commonly used $l_1$ or
$l_2$ loss, DLS is more compatible with the inherent dynamics of the network
training process, thus achieving enhanced outcomes. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, particularly excelling
in complex mixed datasets.

Result: 在两个长尾食物基准数据集上表现优异，top-1准确率优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了长尾食物分类问题，通过合成数据增强提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Deep learning-based food image classification enables precise identification
of food categories, further facilitating accurate nutritional analysis.
However, real-world food images often show a skewed distribution, with some
food types being more prevalent than others. This class imbalance can be
problematic, causing models to favor the majority (head) classes with overall
performance degradation for the less common (tail) classes. Recently, synthetic
data augmentation using diffusion-based generative models has emerged as a
promising solution to address this issue. By generating high-quality synthetic
images, these models can help uniformize the data distribution, potentially
improving classification performance. However, existing approaches face
challenges: fine-tuning-based methods need a uniformly distributed dataset,
while pre-trained model-based approaches often overlook inter-class separation
in synthetic data. In this paper, we propose a two-stage synthetic data
augmentation framework, leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for long-tailed
food classification. We generate a reference set conditioned by a positive
prompt on the generation target and then select a class that shares similar
features with the generation target as a negative prompt. Subsequently, we
generate a synthetic augmentation set using positive and negative prompt
conditions by a combined sampling strategy that promotes intra-class diversity
and inter-class separation. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method
on two long-tailed food benchmark datasets, achieving superior performance
compared to previous works in terms of top-1 accuracy.

TL;DR: PointT2I是一个利用大语言模型（LLM）生成与文本提示中人体姿势准确对应的图像的框架，包含关键点生成、图像生成和反馈系统三部分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管文本到图像（T2I）生成模型已取得显著进展，但在处理复杂概念（如人体姿势）时仍存在挑战。

Method: PointT2I通过LLM生成关键点，结合文本提示生成图像，并使用反馈系统评估语义一致性。

Result: 该框架无需微调即可生成与文本提示中姿势准确对齐的图像。

Conclusion: PointT2I是首个利用LLM实现无微调的关键点引导图像生成的框架。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation model has made significant advancements,
resulting in high-quality images aligned with an input prompt. However, despite
T2I generation's ability to generate fine-grained images, it still faces
challenges in accurately generating images when the input prompt contains
complex concepts, especially human pose. In this paper, we propose PointT2I, a
framework that effectively generates images that accurately correspond to the
human pose described in the prompt by using a large language model (LLM).
PointT2I consists of three components: Keypoint generation, Image generation,
and Feedback system. The keypoint generation uses an LLM to directly generate
keypoints corresponding to a human pose, solely based on the input prompt,
without external references. Subsequently, the image generation produces images
based on both the text prompt and the generated keypoints to accurately reflect
the target pose. To refine the outputs of the preceding stages, we incorporate
an LLM-based feedback system that assesses the semantic consistency between the
generated contents and the given prompts. Our framework is the first approach
to leveraging LLM for keypoints-guided image generation without any
fine-tuning, producing accurate pose-aligned images based solely on textual
prompts.

Result: SVQA-R1在空间视觉问答基准测试中显著提升准确性，且无需监督微调数据即可展示可解释的推理路径。

Conclusion: SVQA-R1在多个空间推理基准测试中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a critical yet underdeveloped capability in
existing vision-language models (VLMs), especially for Spatial Visual Question
Answering (Spatial VQA) tasks that require understanding relative positions,
distances, and object configurations. Inspired by the R1 paradigm introduced in
DeepSeek-R1, which enhances reasoning in language models through rule-based
reinforcement learning (RL), we propose SVQA-R1, the first framework to extend
R1-style training to spatial VQA. In particular, we introduce Spatial-GRPO, a
novel group-wise RL strategy that constructs view-consistent rewards by
perturbing spatial relations between objects, e.g., mirror flipping, thereby
encouraging the model to develop a consistent and grounded understanding of
space. Our model, SVQA-R1, not only achieves dramatically improved accuracy on
spatial VQA benchmarks but also exhibits interpretable reasoning paths even
without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data. Extensive experiments and
visualization demonstrate the effectiveness of SVQA-R1 across multiple spatial
reasoning benchmarks.

Result: 在SportsMOT、DanceTrack、SoccerNet-tracking 2022和MOT17数据集上表现优异，适用于体育和行人跟踪。

Conclusion: McByte展示了掩码传播对提升多目标跟踪适应性和泛化能力的优势，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) is essential for sports analytics, enabling
performance evaluation and tactical insights. However, tracking in sports is
challenging due to fast movements, occlusions, and camera shifts. Traditional
tracking-by-detection methods require extensive tuning, while
segmentation-based approaches struggle with track processing. We propose
McByte, a tracking-by-detection framework that integrates temporally propagated
segmentation mask as an association cue to improve robustness without per-video
tuning. Unlike many existing methods, McByte does not require training, relying
solely on pre-trained models and object detectors commonly used in the
community. Evaluated on SportsMOT, DanceTrack, SoccerNet-tracking 2022 and
MOT17, McByte demonstrates strong performance across sports and general
pedestrian tracking. Our results highlight the benefits of mask propagation for
a more adaptable and generalizable MOT approach. Code will be made available at

Abstract: High-Fidelity 3D scene reconstruction plays a crucial role in autonomous
driving by enabling novel data generation from existing datasets. This allows
simulating safety-critical scenarios and augmenting training datasets without
incurring further data collection costs. While recent advances in radiance
fields have demonstrated promising results in 3D reconstruction and sensor data
synthesis using cameras and LiDAR, their potential for radar remains largely
unexplored. Radar is crucial for autonomous driving due to its robustness in
adverse weather conditions like rain, fog, and snow, where optical sensors
often struggle. Although the state-of-the-art radar-based neural representation
shows promise for 3D driving scene reconstruction, it performs poorly in
scenarios with significant radar noise, including receiver saturation and
multipath reflection. Moreover, it is limited to synthesizing preprocessed,
noise-excluded radar images, failing to address realistic radar data synthesis.
To address these limitations, this paper proposes RadarSplat, which integrates
Gaussian Splatting with novel radar noise modeling to enable realistic radar
data synthesis and enhanced 3D reconstruction. Compared to the
state-of-the-art, RadarSplat achieves superior radar image synthesis (+3.4 PSNR
/ 2.6x SSIM) and improved geometric reconstruction (-40% RMSE / 1.5x Accuracy),
demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-fidelity radar data and
scene reconstruction. A project page is available at

Conclusion: NFD通过技术创新显著提升了自回归视频模型的实时生成能力，为交互式和流媒体应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive video models offer distinct advantages over bidirectional
diffusion models in creating interactive video content and supporting streaming
applications with arbitrary duration. In this work, we present Next-Frame
Diffusion (NFD), an autoregressive diffusion transformer that incorporates
block-wise causal attention, enabling iterative sampling and efficient
inference via parallel token generation within each frame. Nonetheless,
achieving real-time video generation remains a significant challenge for such
models, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with diffusion
sampling and the hardware inefficiencies inherent to autoregressive generation.
To address this, we introduce two innovations: (1) We extend consistency
distillation to the video domain and adapt it specifically for video models,
enabling efficient inference with few sampling steps; (2) To fully leverage
parallel computation, motivated by the observation that adjacent frames often
share the identical action input, we propose speculative sampling. In this
approach, the model generates next few frames using current action input, and
discard speculatively generated frames if the input action differs. Experiments
on a large-scale action-conditioned video generation benchmark demonstrate that
NFD beats autoregressive baselines in terms of both visual quality and sampling
efficiency. We, for the first time, achieves autoregressive video generation at
over 30 Frames Per Second (FPS) on an A100 GPU using a 310M model.

Abstract: Active-stereo-based 3D shape measurement is crucial for various purposes,
such as industrial inspection, reverse engineering, and medical systems, due to
its strong ability to accurately acquire the shape of textureless objects.
Active stereo systems typically consist of a camera and a pattern projector,
tightly fixed to each other, and precise calibration between a camera and a
projector is required, which in turn decreases the usability of the system. If
a camera and a projector can be freely moved during shape scanning process, it
will drastically increase the convenience of the usability of the system. To
realize it, we propose a technique to recover the shape of the target object by
capturing multiple images while both the camera and the projector are in
motion, and their relative poses are auto-calibrated by our neural
signed-distance-field (NeuralSDF) using novel volumetric differential rendering
technique. In the experiment, the proposed method is evaluated by performing 3D
reconstruction using both synthetic and real images.

established a new benchmark for real-world image restoration, featuring diverse
scenarios with and without reference ground truth. Participants were tasked
with restoring real-captured images suffering from complex and unknown
degradations, where both perceptual quality and fidelity were critically
evaluated. The challenge comprised two tracks: (1) the low-light joint
denoising and demosaicing (JDD) task, and (2) the image detail
enhancement/generation task. Each track included two sub-tasks. The first
sub-task involved paired data with available ground truth, enabling
quantitative evaluation. The second sub-task dealt with real-world yet unpaired
images, emphasizing restoration efficiency and subjective quality assessed
through a comprehensive user study. In total, the challenge attracted nearly
300 registrations, with 51 teams submitting more than 600 results. The
top-performing methods advanced the state of the art in image restoration and
received unanimous recognition from all 20+ expert judges. The datasets used in
Track 1 and Track 2 are available at
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Mgqve-yNcE26IIieI8lMIf-25VvZRs_J and

Abstract: The Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) task aims to identify various
detailed attributes of an individual, such as clothing, accessories, and
gender. To enhance PAR performance, a model must capture features ranging from
coarse-grained global attributes (e.g., for identifying gender) to fine-grained
local details (e.g., for recognizing accessories) that may appear in diverse
regions. Recent research suggests that body part representation can enhance the
model's robustness and accuracy, but these methods are often restricted to
attribute classes within fixed horizontal regions, leading to degraded
performance when attributes appear in varying or unexpected body locations. In
this paper, we propose Visual and Textual Attribute Alignment with Attribute
Prompting for Pedestrian Attribute Recognition, dubbed as ViTA-PAR, to enhance
attribute recognition through specialized multimodal prompting and
vision-language alignment. We introduce visual attribute prompts that capture
global-to-local semantics, enabling diverse attribute representations. To
enrich textual embeddings, we design a learnable prompt template, termed person
and attribute context prompting, to learn person and attributes context.
Finally, we align visual and textual attribute features for effective fusion.
ViTA-PAR is validated on four PAR benchmarks, achieving competitive performance
with efficient inference. We release our code and model at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种系统性方法，通过激励推理来提升大语言模型（LLMs）处理复杂指令的能力，解决了传统思维链（CoT）方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在遵循复杂指令时面临挑战，尤其是当指令包含并行、链式和分支结构的约束时。传统的思维链方法因浅层推理模式而表现不佳。

Method: 1. 基于现有分类法分解复杂指令并提出可复现的数据获取方法；2. 利用强化学习（RL）和基于规则的可验证奖励信号，培养指令遵循的推理能力；3. 通过样本对比和行为克隆优化推理过程。

Result: 在七个综合基准测试中，1.5B参数的LLM性能提升11.74%，表现接近8B参数的LLM。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLM处理复杂指令的能力，验证了其优越性。代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex
instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in
paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely
chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of
LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on
performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the
instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for
identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To
this end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex
instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First,
we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing
taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we
exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals
to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the
shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via
sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior
cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking
LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive
benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM
achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM. Codes and data
are available at https://github.com/yuleiqin/RAIF.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DNAEdit的新方法，通过直接优化噪声域中的高斯噪声（DNA）和移动速度引导（MVG），显著减少了传统方法中的误差累积，提升了图像编辑性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于扩散和RF的方法在图像编辑中因逐步添加噪声导致误差累积，影响重建精度。

Method: 提出Direct Noise Alignment (DNA)直接优化噪声，并结合Mobile Velocity Guidance (MVG)平衡背景保留和目标编辑。

Result: 实验证明DNAEdit在文本引导的图像编辑中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DNAEdit通过减少误差累积和引入MVG，显著提升了图像编辑的准确性和可控性。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful generation capability of large-scale pretrained
text-to-image models, training-free methods have demonstrated impressive image
editing results. Conventional diffusion-based methods, as well as recent
rectified flow (RF)-based methods, typically reverse synthesis trajectories by
gradually adding noise to clean images, during which the noisy latent at the
current timestep is used to approximate that at the next timesteps, introducing
accumulated drift and degrading reconstruction accuracy. Considering the fact
that in RF the noisy latent is estimated through direct interpolation between
Gaussian noises and clean images at each timestep, we propose Direct Noise
Alignment (DNA), which directly refines the desired Gaussian noise in the noise
domain, significantly reducing the error accumulation in previous methods.
Specifically, DNA estimates the velocity field of the interpolated noised
latent at each timestep and adjusts the Gaussian noise by computing the
difference between the predicted and expected velocity field. We validate the
effectiveness of DNA and reveal its relationship with existing RF-based
inversion methods. Additionally, we introduce a Mobile Velocity Guidance (MVG)
to control the target prompt-guided generation process, balancing image
background preservation and target object editability. DNA and MVG collectively
constitute our proposed method, namely DNAEdit. Finally, we introduce
DNA-Bench, a long-prompt benchmark, to evaluate the performance of advanced
image editing models. Experimental results demonstrate that our DNAEdit
achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art text-guided editing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义调色板的颜色传播方法，通过提取语义调色板并优化能量函数，实现内容感知的局部颜色编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖低层次视觉线索（如颜色、纹理或亮度）难以实现内容感知的颜色传播，而现有引入语义信息的方法常导致全局颜色变化不自然。

Method: 从输入图像中提取语义调色板，通过最小化设计的能量函数求解编辑后的调色板，并基于语义相似性传播局部颜色编辑。

Result: 实验证明该方法能够高效且精确地实现像素级颜色编辑，确保颜色传播内容感知。

Conclusion: 提出的语义调色板引导方法克服了传统方法的局限性，实现了更自然的局部颜色传播。

Abstract: Color propagation aims to extend local color edits to similar regions across
the input image. Conventional approaches often rely on low-level visual cues
such as color, texture, or lightness to measure pixel similarity, making it
difficult to achieve content-aware color propagation. While some recent
approaches attempt to introduce semantic information into color editing, but
often lead to unnatural, global color change in color adjustments. To overcome
these limitations, we present a semantic palette-guided approach for color
propagation. We first extract a semantic palette from an input image. Then, we
solve an edited palette by minimizing a well-designed energy function based on
user edits. Finally, local edits are accurately propagated to regions that
share similar semantics via the solved palette. Our approach enables efficient
yet accurate pixel-level color editing and ensures that local color changes are
propagated in a content-aware manner. Extensive experiments demonstrated the
effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Although multi-scale concepts have recently proven useful for recurrent
network architectures in the field of optical flow and stereo, they have not
been considered for image-based scene flow so far. Hence, based on a
single-scale recurrent scene flow backbone, we develop a multi-scale approach
that generalizes successful hierarchical ideas from optical flow to image-based
scene flow. By considering suitable concepts for the feature and the context
encoder, the overall coarse-to-fine framework and the training loss, we succeed
to design a scene flow approach that outperforms the current state of the art
on KITTI and Spring by 8.7%(3.89 vs. 4.26) and 65.8% (9.13 vs. 26.71),
respectively. Our code is available at

Abstract: Sonar imaging is fundamental to underwater exploration, with critical
applications in defense, navigation, and marine research. Shadow regions, in
particular, provide essential cues for object detection and classification, yet
existing studies primarily focus on highlight-based analysis, leaving
shadow-based classification underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a
Context-adaptive sonar image classification framework that leverages advanced
image processing techniques to extract and integrate discriminative shadow and
highlight features. Our framework introduces a novel shadow-specific classifier
and adaptive shadow segmentation, enabling effective classification based on
the dominant region. This approach ensures optimal feature representation,
improving robustness against noise and occlusions. In addition, we introduce a
Region-aware denoising model that enhances sonar image quality by preserving
critical structural details while suppressing noise. This model incorporates an
explainability-driven optimization strategy, ensuring that denoising is guided
by feature importance, thereby improving interpretability and classification
reliability. Furthermore, we present S3Simulator+, an extended dataset
incorporating naval mine scenarios with physics-informed noise specifically
tailored for the underwater sonar domain, fostering the development of robust
AI models. By combining novel classification strategies with an enhanced
dataset, our work addresses key challenges in sonar image analysis,
contributing
  to the advancement of autonomous underwater perception.

Conclusion: DiffuseSlide计算高效且适应性强，适用于虚拟现实、游戏和高质量内容创作。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have revolutionized video generation,
enabling the creation of high-quality, temporally consistent videos. However,
generating high frame-rate (FPS) videos remains a significant challenge due to
issues such as flickering and degradation in long sequences, particularly in
fast-motion scenarios. Existing methods often suffer from computational
inefficiencies and limitations in maintaining video quality over extended
frames. In this paper, we present a novel, training-free approach for high FPS
video generation using pre-trained diffusion models. Our method, DiffuseSlide,
introduces a new pipeline that leverages key frames from low FPS videos and
applies innovative techniques, including noise re-injection and sliding window
latent denoising, to achieve smooth, consistent video outputs without the need
for additional fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
our approach significantly improves video quality, offering enhanced temporal
coherence and spatial fidelity. The proposed method is not only computationally
efficient but also adaptable to various video generation tasks, making it ideal
for applications such as virtual reality, video games, and high-quality content
creation.

Result: SVTA包含41,315个视频（1.36M帧），覆盖68种异常事件和30种正常活动，测试表明其具有挑战性和有效性。

Conclusion: SVTA消除了真实数据收集的隐私风险，同时保持了现实场景，为跨模态检索提供了有效基准。

Abstract: Video anomaly retrieval aims to localize anomalous events in videos using
natural language queries to facilitate public safety. However, existing
datasets suffer from severe limitations: (1) data scarcity due to the long-tail
nature of real-world anomalies, and (2) privacy constraints that impede
large-scale collection. To address the aforementioned issues in one go, we
introduce SVTA (Synthetic Video-Text Anomaly benchmark), the first large-scale
dataset for cross-modal anomaly retrieval, leveraging generative models to
overcome data availability challenges. Specifically, we collect and generate
video descriptions via the off-the-shelf LLM (Large Language Model) covering 68
anomaly categories, e.g., throwing, stealing, and shooting. These descriptions
encompass common long-tail events. We adopt these texts to guide the video
generative model to produce diverse and high-quality videos. Finally, our SVTA
involves 41,315 videos (1.36M frames) with paired captions, covering 30 normal
activities, e.g., standing, walking, and sports, and 68 anomalous events, e.g.,
falling, fighting, theft, explosions, and natural disasters. We adopt three
widely-used video-text retrieval baselines to comprehensively test our SVTA,
revealing SVTA's challenging nature and its effectiveness in evaluating a
robust cross-modal retrieval method. SVTA eliminates privacy risks associated
with real-world anomaly collection while maintaining realistic scenarios. The

Result: YOLOv8n的mAP为59.30%，WGNN模型在轻量级设备上的准确率达到92.71%。

Conclusion: WGNN模型在绵羊疼痛检测中表现出色，为自动监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately recognizing and assessing pain in sheep is key to discern animal
health and mitigating harmful situations. However, such accuracy is limited by
the ability to manage automatic monitoring of pain in those animals. Facial
expression scoring is a widely used and useful method to evaluate pain in both
humans and other living beings. Researchers also analyzed the facial
expressions of sheep to assess their health state and concluded that facial
landmark detection and pain level prediction are essential. For this purpose,
we propose a novel weighted graph neural network (WGNN) model to link sheep's
detected facial landmarks and define pain levels. Furthermore, we propose a new
sheep facial landmarks dataset that adheres to the parameters of the Sheep
Facial Expression Scale (SPFES). Currently, there is no comprehensive
performance benchmark that specifically evaluates the use of graph neural
networks (GNNs) on sheep facial landmark data to detect and measure pain
levels. The YOLOv8n detector architecture achieves a mean average precision
(mAP) of 59.30% with the sheep facial landmarks dataset, among seven other
detection models. The WGNN framework has an accuracy of 92.71% for tracking
multiple facial parts expressions with the YOLOv8n lightweight on-board device
deployment-capable model.

Abstract: Accurate surgical phase recognition is crucial for computer-assisted
interventions and surgical video analysis. Annotating long surgical videos is
labor-intensive, driving research toward leveraging unlabeled data for strong
performance with minimal annotations. Although self-supervised learning has
gained popularity by enabling large-scale pretraining followed by fine-tuning
on small labeled subsets, semi-supervised approaches remain largely
underexplored in the surgical domain. In this work, we propose a video
transformer-based model with a robust pseudo-labeling framework. Our method
incorporates temporal consistency regularization for unlabeled data and
contrastive learning with class prototypes, which leverages both labeled data
and pseudo-labels to refine the feature space. Through extensive experiments on
the private RAMIE (Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy) dataset and
the public Cholec80 dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
By incorporating unlabeled data, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on
RAMIE with a 4.9% accuracy increase and obtain comparable results to full
supervision while using only 1/4 of the labeled data on Cholec80. Our findings
establish a strong benchmark for semi-supervised surgical phase recognition,
paving the way for future research in this domain.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了视觉理解和生成的协同进化，推动了MLLMs从文本到图像任务向统一图像生成的进步。

Abstract: Recent endeavors in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) aim to unify
visual comprehension and generation. However, these two capabilities remain
largely independent, as if they are two separate functions encapsulated within
the same model. Consequently, visual comprehension does not enhance visual
generation, and the reasoning mechanisms of LLMs have not been fully integrated
to revolutionize image generation. In this paper, we propose to enable the
collaborative co-evolution of visual comprehension and generation, advancing
image generation into an iterative introspective process. We introduce a
two-stage training approach: supervised fine-tuning teaches the MLLM with the
foundational ability to generate genuine CoT for visual generation, while
reinforcement learning activates its full potential via an
exploration-exploitation trade-off. Ultimately, we unlock the Aha moment in
visual generation, advancing MLLMs from text-to-image tasks to unified image
generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model not only excels in
text-to-image generation and image editing, but also functions as a superior
image semantic evaluator with enhanced visual comprehension capabilities.

Result: 在Action Genome数据集上，FDSG在动态场景图生成、场景图预测和场景图预报任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FDSG通过建模实体和关系的动态变化，显著提升了视频场景理解的性能。

Abstract: Dynamic scene graph generation extends scene graph generation from images to
videos by modeling entity relationships and their temporal evolution. However,
existing methods either generate scene graphs from observed frames without
explicitly modeling temporal dynamics, or predict only relationships while
assuming static entity labels and locations. These limitations hinder effective
extrapolation of both entity and relationship dynamics, restricting video scene
understanding. We propose Forecasting Dynamic Scene Graphs (FDSG), a novel
framework that predicts future entity labels, bounding boxes, and
relationships, for unobserved frames, while also generating scene graphs for
observed frames. Our scene graph forecast module leverages query decomposition
and neural stochastic differential equations to model entity and relationship
dynamics. A temporal aggregation module further refines predictions by
integrating forecasted and observed information via cross-attention. To
benchmark FDSG, we introduce Scene Graph Forecasting, a new task for full
future scene graph prediction. Experiments on Action Genome show that FDSG
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on dynamic scene graph generation, scene
graph anticipation, and scene graph forecasting. Codes will be released upon
publication.

Result: SCAD在低训练成本下实现与最新大规模GAN相当的零样本FID，同时提升生成多样性。

Conclusion: SCAD是一种高效且高保真的文本到图像生成模型，未牺牲多样性。

Abstract: Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been successfully
scaled to billion-scale large text-to-image datasets. However, training such
models entails a high training cost, limiting some applications and research
usage. To reduce the cost, one promising direction is the incorporation of
pre-trained models. The existing method of utilizing pre-trained models for a
generator significantly reduced the training cost compared with the other
large-scale GANs, but we found the model loses the diversity of generation for
a given prompt by a large margin. To build an efficient and high-fidelity
text-to-image GAN without compromise, we propose to use two specialized
discriminators with Slicing Adversarial Networks (SANs) adapted for
text-to-image tasks. Our proposed model, called SCAD, shows a notable
enhancement in diversity for a given prompt with better sample fidelity. We
also propose to use a metric called Per-Prompt Diversity (PPD) to evaluate the
diversity of text-to-image models quantitatively. SCAD achieved a zero-shot FID
competitive with the latest large-scale GANs at two orders of magnitude less
training cost.

Abstract: Preference alignment in diffusion models has primarily focused on benign
human preferences (e.g., aesthetic). In this paper, we propose a novel
perspective: framing unrestricted adversarial example generation as a problem
of aligning with adversary preferences. Unlike benign alignment, adversarial
alignment involves two inherently conflicting preferences: visual consistency
and attack effectiveness, which often lead to unstable optimization and reward
hacking (e.g., reducing visual quality to improve attack success). To address
this, we propose APA (Adversary Preferences Alignment), a two-stage framework
that decouples conflicting preferences and optimizes each with differentiable
rewards. In the first stage, APA fine-tunes LoRA to improve visual consistency
using rule-based similarity reward. In the second stage, APA updates either the
image latent or prompt embedding based on feedback from a substitute
classifier, guided by trajectory-level and step-wise rewards. To enhance
black-box transferability, we further incorporate a diffusion augmentation
strategy. Experiments demonstrate that APA achieves significantly better attack
transferability while maintaining high visual consistency, inspiring further
research to approach adversarial attacks from an alignment perspective. Code
will be available at https://github.com/deep-kaixun/APA.

### [463] [Speed-up of Vision Transformer Models by Attention-aware Token Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01519)
*Takahiro Naruko,Hiroaki Akutsu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ATF的新方法，用于加速ViT模型，通过动态和静态过滤策略减少计算负担，同时保持任务准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT模型在图像嵌入提取中表现出色，但计算负担高，需要一种方法在不影响性能的情况下加速模型。

Method: ATF方法包括一个令牌过滤模块和过滤策略，动态保留特定对象类型的令牌，静态保留高注意力区域的令牌。

Result: 在检索任务中，ATF将ViT模型SigLIP的速度提高了2.8倍，同时保持了检索召回率。

Conclusion: ATF是一种有效的ViT模型加速方法，能够在减少计算负担的同时保持性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) models have made breakthroughs in image embedding
extraction, which provide state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as
zero-shot image classification. However, the models suffer from a high
computational burden. In this paper, we propose a novel speed-up method for ViT
models called Attention-aware Token Filtering (ATF). ATF consists of two main
ideas: a novel token filtering module and a filtering strategy. The token
filtering module is introduced between a tokenizer and a transformer encoder of
the ViT model, without modifying or fine-tuning of the transformer encoder. The
module filters out tokens inputted to the encoder so that it keeps tokens in
regions of specific object types dynamically and keeps tokens in regions that
statically receive high attention in the transformer encoder. This filtering
strategy maintains task accuracy while filtering out tokens inputted to the
transformer encoder. Evaluation results on retrieval tasks show that ATF
provides $2.8\times$ speed-up to a ViT model, SigLIP, while maintaining the
retrieval recall rate.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将种族标签从离散值改为连续变量，以更准确地平衡数据集，并证明连续空间平衡的数据集训练出的模型性能更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸识别模型中的偏见问题长期存在，现有方法对数据偏见的缓解有限且缺乏对问题本质的深入理解。

Method: 将种族标签作为连续变量而非离散值，通过实验和理论验证其有效性，并训练多种模型和数据集子集进行比较。

Result: 连续空间平衡的数据集训练的模型性能优于离散空间平衡的数据集，且不同种族身份对数据集平衡的贡献不均。

Conclusion: 种族标签的连续化处理能更有效地解决数据偏见问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Bias has been a constant in face recognition models. Over the years,
researchers have looked at it from both the model and the data point of view.
However, their approach to mitigation of data bias was limited and lacked
insight on the real nature of the problem. Here, in this document, we propose
to revise our use of ethnicity labels as a continuous variable instead of a
discrete value per identity. We validate our formulation both experimentally
and theoretically, showcasing that not all identities from one ethnicity
contribute equally to the balance of the dataset; thus, having the same number
of identities per ethnicity does not represent a balanced dataset. We further
show that models trained on datasets balanced in the continuous space
consistently outperform models trained on data balanced in the discrete space.
We trained more than 65 different models, and created more than 20 subsets of
the original datasets.

Conclusion: 鼓励进一步探索生成方法解决判别任务，证明了生成差异的有效性。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of utilizing a large-scale text-to-image
diffusion model to tackle the challenging Inexact Segmentation (IS) task.
Unlike traditional approaches that rely heavily on discriminative-model-based
paradigms or dense visual representations derived from internal attention
mechanisms, our method focuses on the intrinsic generative priors in Stable
Diffusion~(SD). Specifically, we exploit the pattern discrepancies between
original images and mask-conditional generated images to facilitate a
coarse-to-fine segmentation refinement by establishing a semantic
correspondence alignment and updating the foreground probability. Comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness and
superiority of our plug-and-play design, underscoring the potential of
leveraging generation discrepancies to model dense representations and
encouraging further exploration of generative approaches for solving
discriminative tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分层解耦和蒸馏方法，用于构建简单有效的长期驾驶世界模型，显著提升了长视频生成的连贯性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前驾驶世界模型在预测长期未来时存在严重误差累积，且训练与推理之间存在差距，限制了实际应用。

Method: 分层解耦为大规模运动和双向连续运动学习，并提出蒸馏方法以自监督信号提升视频连贯性。

Result: 在NuScenes基准测试中，FVD提升27%，推理时间减少85%，能生成110+帧的连贯视频。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了长期视频生成的连贯性问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Driving world models are used to simulate futures by video generation based
on the condition of the current state and actions. However, current models
often suffer serious error accumulations when predicting the long-term future,
which limits the practical application. Recent studies utilize the Diffusion
Transformer (DiT) as the backbone of driving world models to improve learning
flexibility. However, these models are always trained on short video clips
(high fps and short duration), and multiple roll-out generations struggle to
produce consistent and reasonable long videos due to the training-inference
gap. To this end, we propose several solutions to build a simple yet effective
long-term driving world model. First, we hierarchically decouple world model
learning into large motion learning and bidirectional continuous motion
learning. Then, considering the continuity of driving scenes, we propose a
simple distillation method where fine-grained video flows are self-supervised
signals for coarse-grained flows. The distillation is designed to improve the
coherence of infinite video generation. The coarse-grained and fine-grained
modules are coordinated to generate long-term and temporally coherent videos.
In the public benchmark NuScenes, compared with the state-of-the-art front-view
model, our model improves FVD by $27\%$ and reduces inference time by $85\%$
for the video task of generating 110+ frames. More videos (including 90s
duration) are available at https://Wang-Xiaodong1899.github.io/longdwm/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法因直接输入输出映射导致的决策难解释和训练困难问题，同时避免纯CoT监督微调可能导致的过拟合。

Method: 分两阶段训练：1) 使用格式化CoT标签进行监督微调；2) 通过自反射后训练，利用模型自身推理输出作为标签增强监督多样性。

Result: 在主流VLN基准测试中表现优于现有LLM-based方法。

Conclusion: EvolveNav通过自改进推理框架显著提升了导航决策的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Building Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents which can navigate following
natural language instructions is a long-standing goal in human-robot
interaction applications. Recent studies have revealed the potential of
training open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning
ability for improving navigation, and simultaneously mitigate the domain gap
between LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these approaches
primarily adopt direct input-output mapping paradigms, causing the mapping
learning difficult and the navigational decisions unexplainable.
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve both navigational
decision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity of the navigation
task makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to overfitting
through pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel
sElf-improving embodied reasoning framework for boosting LLM-based
vision-language Navigation, dubbed EvolveNav. Our EvolveNav consists of two
stages: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we train the model
with formalized CoT labels to both activate the model's navigational reasoning
capabilities and increase the reasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective
Post-Training, where the model is iteratively trained with its own reasoning
outputs as self-enriched CoT labels to enhance the supervision diversity. A
self-reflective auxiliary task is also introduced to encourage learning correct
reasoning patterns by contrasting with wrong ones. Experimental results on the
popular VLN benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of EvolveNav over previous
LLM-based VLN approaches. Code is available at

TL;DR: SAM2-LOVE框架通过多模态融合和时空一致性策略，显著提升了Ref-AVS任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有双模态方法因缺乏第三模态和三模态方法因时空不一致性导致的目标偏移问题。

Method: 提出SAM2-LOVE框架，融合文本、音频和视觉表示，并采用token传播与累积策略增强时空一致性。

Result: 在Ref-AVS基准测试中，性能提升8.5%（J&F指标）。

Conclusion: SAM2-LOVE框架简单有效，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Reference Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to provide a pixel-wise
scene understanding in Language-aided Audio-Visual Scenes (LAVS). This task
requires the model to continuously segment objects referred to by text and
audio from a video. Previous dual-modality methods always fail due to the lack
of a third modality and the existing triple-modality method struggles with
spatio-temporal consistency, leading to the target shift of different frames.
In this work, we introduce a novel framework, termed SAM2-LOVE, which
integrates textual, audio, and visual representations into a learnable token to
prompt and align SAM2 for achieving Ref-AVS in the LAVS. Technically, our
approach includes a multimodal fusion module aimed at improving multimodal
understanding of SAM2, as well as token propagation and accumulation strategies
designed to enhance spatio-temporal consistency without forgetting historical
information. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate that SAM2-LOVE
outperforms the SOTA by 8.5\% in $\mathcal{J\&F}$ on the Ref-AVS benchmark and
showcase the simplicity and effectiveness of the components. Our code will be
available here.

TL;DR: HOSIG框架通过分层场景感知合成全身交互，解决了现有方法忽略场景上下文的问题，结合了场景感知抓取、导航算法和运动扩散模型，实现了高保真交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在人与物体或场景交互时往往忽略场景上下文，导致不合理的穿透或协调问题，需要一种综合解决方案。

Method: HOSIG框架分为三部分：场景感知抓取生成器、启发式导航算法和场景引导的运动扩散模型，分别处理碰撞避免、路径规划和精确运动生成。

Result: 在TRUMANS数据集上表现优于现有方法，支持无限长度运动生成且需少量人工干预。

Conclusion: HOSIG填补了场景感知导航与灵巧物体操作之间的关键空白，推动了交互合成的前沿。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity full-body human interactions with dynamic objects
and static scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and
animation. Existing methods for human-object interaction often neglect scene
context, leading to implausible penetrations, while human-scene interaction
approaches struggle to coordinate fine-grained manipulations with long-range
navigation. To address these limitations, we propose HOSIG, a novel framework
for synthesizing full-body interactions through hierarchical scene perception.
Our method decouples the task into three key components: 1) a scene-aware grasp
pose generator that ensures collision-free whole-body postures with precise
hand-object contact by integrating local geometry constraints, 2) a heuristic
navigation algorithm that autonomously plans obstacle-avoiding paths in complex
indoor environments via compressed 2D floor maps and dual-component spatial
reasoning, and 3) a scene-guided motion diffusion model that generates
trajectory-controlled, full-body motions with finger-level accuracy by
incorporating spatial anchors and dual-space classifier-free guidance.
Extensive experiments on the TRUMANS dataset demonstrate superior performance
over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our framework supports unlimited motion
length through autoregressive generation and requires minimal manual
intervention. This work bridges the critical gap between scene-aware navigation
and dexterous object manipulation, advancing the frontier of embodied
interaction synthesis. Codes will be available after publication. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型训练需要大规模数据集，但数据存储和计算成本高，且网络爬取的数据存在噪声，影响模型性能。

Method: MDW通过引入可学习的细粒度对应关系和双轨协作学习，优化蒸馏数据并避免噪声影响。

Result: 实验表明，MDW在不同压缩比下性能优于先前方法15%以上，具有显著的可扩展性。

Conclusion: MDW为多模态模型训练提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent multi-modal models have shown remarkable versatility in real-world
applications. However, their rapid development encounters two critical data
challenges. First, the training process requires large-scale datasets, leading
to substantial storage and computational costs. Second, these data are
typically web-crawled with inevitable noise, i.e., partially mismatched pairs,
severely degrading model performance. To these ends, we propose Multi-modal
dataset Distillation in the Wild, i.e., MDW, the first framework to distill
noisy multi-modal datasets into compact clean ones for effective and efficient
model training. Specifically, MDW introduces learnable fine-grained
correspondences during distillation and adaptively optimizes distilled data to
emphasize correspondence-discriminative regions, thereby enhancing distilled
data's information density and efficacy. Moreover, to capture robust
cross-modal correspondence prior knowledge from real data, MDW proposes
dual-track collaborative learning to avoid the risky data noise, alleviating
information loss with certifiable noise tolerance. Extensive experiments
validate MDW's theoretical and empirical efficacy with remarkable scalability,
surpassing prior methods by over 15% across various compression ratios,
highlighting its appealing practicality for applications with diverse efficacy
and resource needs.

Abstract: Understanding behavior requires datasets that capture humans while carrying
out complex tasks. The kitchen is an excellent environment for assessing human
motor and cognitive function, as many complex actions are naturally exhibited
in kitchens from chopping to cleaning. Here, we introduce the
EPFL-Smart-Kitchen-30 dataset, collected in a noninvasive motion capture
platform inside a kitchen environment. Nine static RGB-D cameras, inertial
measurement units (IMUs) and one head-mounted HoloLens~2 headset were used to
capture 3D hand, body, and eye movements. The EPFL-Smart-Kitchen-30 dataset is
a multi-view action dataset with synchronized exocentric, egocentric, depth,
IMUs, eye gaze, body and hand kinematics spanning 29.7 hours of 16 subjects
cooking four different recipes. Action sequences were densely annotated with
33.78 action segments per minute. Leveraging this multi-modal dataset, we
propose four benchmarks to advance behavior understanding and modeling through
1) a vision-language benchmark, 2) a semantic text-to-motion generation
benchmark, 3) a multi-modal action recognition benchmark, 4) a pose-based
action segmentation benchmark. We expect the EPFL-Smart-Kitchen-30 dataset to
pave the way for better methods as well as insights to understand the nature of
ecologically-valid human behavior. Code and data are available at

Motivation: 现有的CAM及其变体无法直接应用于度量学习模型，因为这些模型缺乏分类器层，限制了其解释性。

Method: 提出了SFAM方法，通过通道贡献重要性分数（CIS）衡量特征重要性，并基于相似性测量构建解释图。

Result: 实验表明，SFAM能为使用欧氏距离或余弦相似度的CNN模型提供高度可解释的视觉解释。

Conclusion: SFAM是一种有效的视觉解释方法，适用于度量学习模型，增强了模型的可信度和解释性。

Abstract: Visual explanation maps enhance the trustworthiness of decisions made by deep
learning models and offer valuable guidance for developing new algorithms in
image recognition tasks. Class activation maps (CAM) and their variants (e.g.,
Grad-CAM and Relevance-CAM) have been extensively employed to explore the
interpretability of softmax-based convolutional neural networks, which require
a fully connected layer as the classifier for decision-making. However, these
methods cannot be directly applied to metric learning models, as such models
lack a fully connected layer functioning as a classifier. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel visual explanation method termed Similar Feature
Activation Map (SFAM). This method introduces the channel-wise contribution
importance score (CIS) to measure feature importance, derived from the
similarity measurement between two image embeddings. The explanation map is
constructed by linearly combining the proposed importance weights with the
feature map from a CNN model. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show
that SFAM provides highly promising interpretable visual explanations for CNN
models using Euclidean distance or cosine similarity as the similarity metric.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) often struggle to interpret
high-resolution images accurately, where fine-grained details are crucial for
complex visual understanding. We introduce Zoom-Refine, a novel training-free
method that enhances MLLM capabilities to address this issue. Zoom-Refine
operates through a synergistic process of \textit{Localized Zoom} and
\textit{Self-Refinement}. In the \textit{Localized Zoom} step, Zoom-Refine
leverages the MLLM to provide a preliminary response to an input query and
identifies the most task-relevant image region by predicting its bounding box
coordinates. During the \textit{Self-Refinement} step, Zoom-Refine then
integrates fine-grained details from the high-resolution crop (identified by
\textit{Localized Zoom}) with its initial reasoning to re-evaluate and refine
its preliminary response. Our method harnesses the MLLM's inherent capabilities
for spatial localization, contextual reasoning and comparative analysis without
requiring additional training or external experts. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the efficacy of Zoom-Refine on two challenging high-resolution
multimodal benchmarks. Code is available at

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
various vision-language tasks. However, they often struggle to comprehensively
understand Earth Observation (EO) data, which is critical for monitoring the
environment and the effects of human activity on it. In this work, we present
EarthMind, a novel vision-language framework for multi-granular and

Spatial Attention Prompting (SAP), which reallocates attention within the LLM
to enhance pixel-level understanding; and (2) Cross-modal Fusion, which aligns
heterogeneous modalities into a shared space and adaptively reweighs tokens
based on their information density for effective fusion. To facilitate
multi-sensor fusion evaluation, we propose EarthMind-Bench, a comprehensive

covering a wide range of perception and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of EarthMind. It achieves state-of-the-art

Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在多模态任务中有所进展，但在细粒度视频运动理解方面仍存在局限，缺乏帧间差异分析和忽略细微视觉线索。视觉提示在静态图像中有效，但在视频中的时间复杂性应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入MotionSight，利用物体中心视觉聚焦和运动模糊作为视觉提示，无需训练即可提升运动理解。同时创建MotionVid-QA数据集，包含40K视频片段和87K问答对。

Conclusion: MotionSight和MotionVid-QA为细粒度视频运动理解提供了创新解决方案，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), their
proficiency in fine-grained video motion understanding remains critically
limited. They often lack inter-frame differencing and tend to average or ignore
subtle visual cues. Furthermore, while visual prompting has shown potential in
static images, its application to video's temporal complexities, particularly
for fine-grained motion understanding, remains largely unexplored. We
investigate whether inherent capability can be unlocked and boost MLLMs' motion
perception and enable distinct visual signatures tailored to decouple object
and camera motion cues. In this study, we introduce MotionSight, a novel
zero-shot method pioneering object-centric visual spotlight and motion blur as
visual prompts to effectively improve fine-grained motion understanding without
training. To convert this into valuable data assets, we curated MotionVid-QA,
the first large-scale dataset for fine-grained video motion understanding, with
hierarchical annotations including SFT and preference data, {\Theta}(40K) video
clips and {\Theta}(87K) QAs. Experiments show MotionSight achieves
state-of-the-art open-source performance and competitiveness with commercial
models. In particular, for fine-grained motion understanding we present a novel
zero-shot technique and a large-scale, high-quality dataset. All the code and
annotations will be publicly available.

Conclusion: SteerPose为多相机系统提供了一种统一的校准和对应关系搜索框架，适用于人类和动物的3D姿态重建。

Abstract: Can freely moving humans or animals themselves serve as calibration targets
for multi-camera systems while simultaneously estimating their correspondences
across views? We humans can solve this problem by mentally rotating the
observed 2D poses and aligning them with those in the target views. Inspired by
this cognitive ability, we propose SteerPose, a neural network that performs
this rotation of 2D poses into another view. By integrating differentiable
matching, SteerPose simultaneously performs extrinsic camera calibration and
correspondence search within a single unified framework. We also introduce a
novel geometric consistency loss that explicitly ensures that the estimated
rotation and correspondences result in a valid translation estimation.
Experimental results on diverse in-the-wild datasets of humans and animals
validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that our method can reconstruct the 3D poses of novel animals in
multi-camera setups by leveraging off-the-shelf 2D pose estimators and our
class-agnostic model.

informativeness of the coreset. The information of individual samples is
measured by importance scores, which capture their influence or difficulty in
model learning. To quantify redundancy, we use pairwise sample similarities,
based on the premise that similar samples contribute similarly to the learning
process. We formalize the coreset selection problem as a discrete quadratic
programming (DQP) task, with the objective of maximizing the total information
content, represented as the sum of individual sample contributions minus the
redundancies introduced by similar samples within the coreset. To ensure
practical scalability, we introduce an efficient gradient-based solver,
complemented by sparsification techniques applied to the similarity matrix and
dataset partitioning strategies. This enables InfoMax to seamlessly scale to
datasets with millions of samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of InfoMax in various data pruning tasks, including image
classification, vision-language pre-training, and instruction tuning for large
language models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ALOR的方法，利用公开数据和视觉语言模型（VLM）改进主动学习（AL），并通过对比调优（CT）和尾部优先采样（TFS）策略显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少数据标注成本，利用公开数据和VLM提升主动学习效率。

Method: 结合公开数据检索任务相关样本，对比调优（CT）和尾部优先采样（TFS）策略。

Result: ALOR方法显著优于现有方法，CT表现最佳，TFS有效缓解数据不平衡。

Conclusion: ALOR通过公开数据和TFS策略显著提升主动学习性能，CT是最佳适应方法。

Abstract: Pretrained on web-scale open data, VLMs offer powerful capabilities for
solving downstream tasks after being adapted to task-specific labeled data.
Yet, data labeling can be expensive and may demand domain expertise. Active
Learning (AL) aims to reduce this expense by strategically selecting the most
informative data for labeling and model training. Recent AL methods have
explored VLMs but have not leveraged publicly available open data, such as
VLM's pretraining data. In this work, we leverage such data by retrieving
task-relevant examples to augment the task-specific examples. As expected,
incorporating them significantly improves AL. Given that our method exploits
open-source VLM and open data, we refer to it as Active Learning with Open
Resources (ALOR). Additionally, most VLM-based AL methods use prompt tuning
(PT) for model adaptation, likely due to its ability to directly utilize
pretrained parameters and the assumption that doing so reduces the risk of
overfitting to limited labeled data. We rigorously compare popular adaptation
approaches, including linear probing (LP), finetuning (FT), and contrastive
tuning (CT). We reveal two key findings: (1) All adaptation approaches benefit
from incorporating retrieved data, and (2) CT resoundingly outperforms other
approaches across AL methods. Further analysis of retrieved data reveals a
naturally imbalanced distribution of task-relevant classes, exposing inherent
biases within the VLM. This motivates our novel Tail First Sampling (TFS)
strategy for AL, an embarrassingly simple yet effective method that prioritizes
sampling data from underrepresented classes to label. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our final method, contrastively finetuning VLM on both
retrieved and TFS-selected labeled data, significantly outperforms existing
methods.

TL;DR: 论文首次系统研究了基于GRPO的强化学习后训练方法，用于提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视频字幕生成中的动作描述能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习在提升大语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力方面取得了显著进展，但在多模态LLMs的视频字幕生成领域仍未被充分探索。

Method: 开发了VideoCap-R1模型，通过结构化思维分析视频主体及其属性和动作，并辅以两种奖励机制（LLM-free思维评分器和LLM辅助字幕评分器）来优化生成的字幕质量。

Result: 实验表明，VideoCap-R1在多个视频字幕基准测试中显著优于Qwen2VL-7B基线模型和SFT训练的对比模型，特别是在动作描述的准确性上表现突出。

Conclusion: GRPO强化学习框架有效建立了结构化推理与全面描述生成之间的联系，显著提升了MLLMs在视频字幕生成中的能力。

Abstract: While recent advances in reinforcement learning have significantly enhanced
reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), these techniques remain
underexplored in multi-modal LLMs for video captioning. This paper presents the
first systematic investigation of GRPO-based RL post-training for video MLLMs,
with the goal of enhancing video MLLMs' capability of describing actions in
videos. Specifically, we develop the VideoCap-R1, which is prompted to first
perform structured thinking that analyzes video subjects with their attributes
and actions before generating complete captions, supported by two specialized
reward mechanisms: a LLM-free think scorer evaluating the structured thinking
quality and a LLM-assisted caption scorer assessing the output quality. The RL
training framework effectively establishes the connection between structured
reasoning and comprehensive description generation, enabling the model to
produce captions with more accurate actions. Our experiments demonstrate that
VideoCap-R1 achieves substantial improvements over the Qwen2VL-7B baseline
using limited samples (1.5k) across multiple video caption benchmarks (DREAM1K:
+4.4 event F1, VDC: +4.2 Acc, CAREBENCH: +3.1 action F1, +6.9 object F1) while
consistently outperforming the SFT-trained counterparts, confirming GRPO's
superiority in enhancing MLLMs' captioning capabilities.

Motivation: 当前MLLMs在视觉评分任务中表现不佳，且缺乏相关数据集和基准测试，因此需要开发一个全面的评估工具。

Method: 收集并整理14个序数回归数据集，提出动态考虑标签候选并提供可解释思路的粗到细处理流程。

Result: 实验证明了该框架的有效性，并为更好的微调策略提供了启示。

Conclusion: STORM为MLLMs在视觉评分任务中的序数回归能力提供了通用且可信的评估工具，支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Visual rating is an essential capability of artificial intelligence (AI) for
multi-dimensional quantification of visual content, primarily applied in
ordinal regression (OR) tasks such as image quality assessment, facial age
estimation, and medical image grading. However, current multi-modal large
language models (MLLMs) under-perform in such visual rating ability while also
suffering the lack of relevant datasets and benchmarks. In this work, we
collect and present STORM, a data collection and benchmark for Stimulating
Trustworthy Ordinal Regression Ability of MLLMs for universal visual rating.
STORM encompasses 14 ordinal regression datasets across five common visual
rating domains, comprising 655K image-level pairs and the corresponding
carefully curated VQAs. Importantly, we also propose a coarse-to-fine
processing pipeline that dynamically considers label candidates and provides
interpretable thoughts, providing MLLMs with a general and trustworthy ordinal
thinking paradigm. This benchmark aims to evaluate the all-in-one and zero-shot
performance of MLLMs in scenarios requiring understanding of the essential
common ordinal relationships of rating labels. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and shed light on better
fine-tuning strategies. The STORM dataset, benchmark, and pre-trained models

area. Datasets and codes are released on the project page:

Motivation: 研究穿戴式XR设备上实时Egocentric Action Recognition（EAR）系统的部署挑战，特别是便携性、电池寿命和计算资源之间的权衡。

Method: 系统分析RGB视频和3D手部姿势在不同采样频率下对EAR性能和CPU使用的影响，探索多种配置以评估精度与计算效率的权衡。

Result: 降低RGB帧采样率并辅以高频3D手部姿势输入，可实现CPU使用降低高达3倍，同时保持高识别精度。

Conclusion: 多模态输入策略是实现XR设备上高效实时EAR的可行方法。

Abstract: The increasing availability of wearable XR devices opens new perspectives for
Egocentric Action Recognition (EAR) systems, which can provide deeper human
understanding and situation awareness. However, deploying real-time algorithms
on these devices can be challenging due to the inherent trade-offs between
portability, battery life, and computational resources. In this work, we
systematically analyze the impact of sampling frequency across different input
modalities - RGB video and 3D hand pose - on egocentric action recognition
performance and CPU usage. By exploring a range of configurations, we provide a
comprehensive characterization of the trade-offs between accuracy and
computational efficiency. Our findings reveal that reducing the sampling rate
of RGB frames, when complemented with higher-frequency 3D hand pose input, can
preserve high accuracy while significantly lowering CPU demands. Notably, we
observe up to a 3x reduction in CPU usage with minimal to no loss in
recognition performance. This highlights the potential of multimodal input
strategies as a viable approach to achieving efficient, real-time EAR on XR
devices.

Motivation: 现有方法通常针对单一任务训练模型，且高质量标注数据成本高昂。

Method: 设计轻量级适配器统一不同任务的条件，采用联合图像-视频学习策略，并引入深度图作为条件。

Result: 训练了8B和2B两种规模的模型，支持10多种任务，8B模型在视频生成任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多任务联合训练，显著提升了模型的通用性和性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown impressive performance in many visual generation
and manipulation tasks. Many existing methods focus on training a model for a
specific task, especially, text-to-video (T2V) generation, while many other
works focus on finetuning the pretrained T2V model for image-to-video (I2V),
video-to-video (V2V), image and video manipulation tasks, etc. However,
training a strong T2V foundation model requires a large amount of high-quality
annotations, which is very costly. In addition, many existing models can
perform only one or several tasks. In this work, we introduce a unified
framework, namely many-for-many, which leverages the available training data
from many different visual generation and manipulation tasks to train a single
model for those different tasks. Specifically, we design a lightweight adapter
to unify the different conditions in different tasks, then employ a joint
image-video learning strategy to progressively train the model from scratch.
Our joint learning leads to a unified visual generation and manipulation model
with improved video generation performance. In addition, we introduce depth
maps as a condition to help our model better perceive the 3D space in visual
generation. Two versions of our model are trained with different model sizes
(8B and 2B), each of which can perform more than 10 different tasks. In
particular, our 8B model demonstrates highly competitive performance in video
generation tasks compared to open-source and even commercial engines. Our
models and source codes are available at https://github.com/leeruibin/MfM.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在无监督多目标分割任务中表现有限，仅能处理简单合成对象或少量真实世界对象。

Method: unMORE采用两阶段流程：第一阶段学习三级对象中心表示，第二阶段利用网络无关的多目标推理模块发现多个对象。

Result: 在6个真实世界基准数据集（包括COCO）上，unMORE显著优于现有方法，尤其在拥挤图像中表现突出。

Conclusion: unMORE为无监督多目标分割提供了高效解决方案，无需人工标签，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: We study the challenging problem of unsupervised multi-object segmentation on
single images. Existing methods, which rely on image reconstruction objectives
to learn objectness or leverage pretrained image features to group similar
pixels, often succeed only in segmenting simple synthetic objects or
discovering a limited number of real-world objects. In this paper, we introduce
unMORE, a novel two-stage pipeline designed to identify many complex objects in
real-world images. The key to our approach involves explicitly learning three
levels of carefully defined object-centric representations in the first stage.
Subsequently, our multi-object reasoning module utilizes these learned object
priors to discover multiple objects in the second stage. Notably, this
reasoning module is entirely network-free and does not require human labels.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that unMORE significantly outperforms all
existing unsupervised methods across 6 real-world benchmark datasets, including
the challenging COCO dataset, achieving state-of-the-art object segmentation
results. Remarkably, our method excels in crowded images where all baselines
collapse.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FAS依赖单一视觉模态，泛化能力有限；MLLMs在多模态理解上的突破为FAS提供了新思路，但缺乏高质量数据集。

Method: 构建FaceCoT数据集（含14种攻击类型和高质量CoT VQA标注），开发强化学习优化的标注模型，并提出CEPL策略。

Result: 实验表明，基于FaceCoT和CEPL的模型在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FaceCoT和CEPL为FAS提供了更鲁棒和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) typically depends on a single visual modality when
defending against presentation attacks such as print attacks, screen replays,
and 3D masks, resulting in limited generalization across devices, environments,
and attack types. Meanwhile, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
recently achieved breakthroughs in image-text understanding and semantic
reasoning, suggesting that integrating visual and linguistic co-inference into
FAS can substantially improve both robustness and interpretability. However,
the lack of a high-quality vision-language multimodal dataset has been a
critical bottleneck. To address this, we introduce FaceCoT (Face
Chain-of-Thought), the first large-scale Visual Question Answering (VQA)
dataset tailored for FAS. FaceCoT covers 14 spoofing attack types and enriches
model learning with high-quality CoT VQA annotations. Meanwhile, we develop a
caption model refined via reinforcement learning to expand the dataset and
enhance annotation quality. Furthermore, we introduce a CoT-Enhanced
Progressive Learning (CEPL) strategy to better leverage the CoT data and boost
model performance on FAS tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models
trained with FaceCoT and CEPL outperform state-of-the-art methods on multiple
benchmark datasets.

Result: R2SM任务为多模态推理和意图感知分割研究提供了挑战性测试平台。

Conclusion: R2SM任务和数据集推动了多模态推理和意图感知分割的进展。

Abstract: We introduce a new task, Referring and Reasoning for Selective Masks (R2SM),
which extends text-guided segmentation by incorporating mask-type selection
driven by user intent. This task challenges vision-language models to determine
whether to generate a modal (visible) or amodal (complete) segmentation mask
based solely on natural language prompts. To support the R2SM task, we present
the R2SM dataset, constructed by augmenting annotations of COCOA-cls, D2SA, and
MUVA. The R2SM dataset consists of both modal and amodal text queries, each
paired with the corresponding ground-truth mask, enabling model finetuning and
evaluation for the ability to segment images as per user intent. Specifically,
the task requires the model to interpret whether a given prompt refers to only
the visible part of an object or to its complete shape, including occluded
regions, and then produce the appropriate segmentation. For example, if a
prompt explicitly requests the whole shape of a partially hidden object, the
model is expected to output an amodal mask that completes the occluded parts.
In contrast, prompts without explicit mention of hidden regions should generate
standard modal masks. The R2SM benchmark provides a challenging and insightful
testbed for advancing research in multimodal reasoning and intent-aware
segmentation.

Motivation: 现有方法在生成3D场景时，视角移动会导致噪声和拉伸问题，限制了场景的探索性。WorldExplorer旨在解决这一问题，实现高质量、稳定的3D场景生成。

Method: 通过多视角一致的360度全景初始化场景，利用视频扩散模型迭代生成场景，结合场景记忆和碰撞检测机制，最终通过3D高斯泼溅优化融合所有视图。

Result: WorldExplorer生成的3D场景在相机大幅移动时仍保持高质量和稳定性，实现了真实且无限制的探索。

Conclusion: WorldExplorer在生成沉浸式、可探索的虚拟3D环境方面迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Generating 3D worlds from text is a highly anticipated goal in computer
vision. Existing works are limited by the degree of exploration they allow
inside of a scene, i.e., produce streched-out and noisy artifacts when moving
beyond central or panoramic perspectives. To this end, we propose
WorldExplorer, a novel method based on autoregressive video trajectory
generation, which builds fully navigable 3D scenes with consistent visual
quality across a wide range of viewpoints. We initialize our scenes by creating
multi-view consistent images corresponding to a 360 degree panorama. Then, we
expand it by leveraging video diffusion models in an iterative scene generation
pipeline. Concretely, we generate multiple videos along short, pre-defined
trajectories, that explore the scene in depth, including motion around objects.
Our novel scene memory conditions each video on the most relevant prior views,
while a collision-detection mechanism prevents degenerate results, like moving
into objects. Finally, we fuse all generated views into a unified 3D
representation via 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization. Compared to prior
approaches, WorldExplorer produces high-quality scenes that remain stable under
large camera motion, enabling for the first time realistic and unrestricted
exploration. We believe this marks a significant step toward generating
immersive and truly explorable virtual 3D environments.

Conclusion: OmniV2V为跨场景视频生成和编辑提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of Diffusion Transformers (DiT) has brought significant
advancements to video generation, especially in text-to-video and
image-to-video tasks. Although video generation is widely applied in various
fields, most existing models are limited to single scenarios and cannot perform
diverse video generation and editing through dynamic content manipulation. We
propose OmniV2V, a video model capable of generating and editing videos across
different scenarios based on various operations, including: object movement,
object addition, mask-guided video edit, try-on, inpainting, outpainting, human
animation, and controllable character video synthesis. We explore a unified
dynamic content manipulation injection module, which effectively integrates the
requirements of the above tasks. In addition, we design a visual-text
instruction module based on LLaVA, enabling the model to effectively understand
the correspondence between visual content and instructions. Furthermore, we
build a comprehensive multi-task data processing system. Since there is data
overlap among various tasks, this system can efficiently provide data
augmentation. Using this system, we construct a multi-type, multi-scenario
OmniV2V dataset and its corresponding OmniV2V-Test benchmark. Extensive
experiments show that OmniV2V works as well as, and sometimes better than, the
best existing open-source and commercial models for many video generation and
editing tasks.

Abstract: Learning an animatable and clothed human avatar model with vivid dynamics and
photorealistic appearance from multi-view videos is an important foundational
research problem in computer graphics and vision. Fueled by recent advances in
implicit representations, the quality of the animatable avatars has achieved an
unprecedented level by attaching the implicit representation to drivable human
template meshes. However, they usually fail to preserve the highest level of
detail, particularly apparent when the virtual camera is zoomed in and when
rendering at 4K resolution and higher. We argue that this limitation stems from
inaccurate surface tracking, specifically, depth misalignment and surface drift
between character geometry and the ground truth surface, which forces the
detailed appearance model to compensate for geometric errors. To address this,
we propose a latent deformation model and supervising the 3D deformation of the
animatable character using guidance from foundational 2D video point trackers,
which offer improved robustness to shading and surface variations, and are less
prone to local minima than differentiable rendering. To mitigate the drift over
time and lack of 3D awareness of 2D point trackers, we introduce a cascaded
training strategy that generates consistent 3D point tracks by anchoring point
tracks to the rendered avatar, which ultimately supervises our avatar at the
vertex and texel level. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising five multi-view video sequences, each over
10 minutes in duration, captured using 40 calibrated 6K-resolution cameras,
featuring subjects dressed in clothing with challenging texture patterns and
wrinkle deformations. Our approach demonstrates significantly improved
performance in rendering quality and geometric accuracy over the prior state of
the art.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了无接触指纹匹配的准确性和可靠性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The increasing demand for hygienic and portable biometric systems has
underscored the critical need for advancements in contactless fingerprint
recognition. Despite its potential, this technology faces notable challenges,
including out-of-focus image acquisition, reduced contrast between fingerprint
ridges and valleys, variations in finger positioning, and perspective
distortion. These factors significantly hinder the accuracy and reliability of
contactless fingerprint matching. To address these issues, we propose a novel
multi-stage transformer-based contactless fingerprint matching approach that
first captures global spatial features and subsequently refines localized
feature alignment across fingerprint samples. By employing a hierarchical
feature extraction and matching pipeline, our method ensures fine-grained,
cross-sample alignment while maintaining the robustness of global feature
representation. We perform extensive evaluations on publicly available datasets
such as HKPolyU and RidgeBase under different evaluation protocols, such as
contactless-to-contact matching and contactless-to-contactless matching and
demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing methods, including
COTS solutions.

Gaussian Splats (GS) as a promising format for next-generation immersive media.
However, their high storage requirements pose significant challenges for

flexible combinations and comprehensive comparisons. By integrating best
practices from community research and our own explorations, GSCodec Studio
supports the development of compact representation and compression solutions

Conclusion: MoDA是一种有效的通用增强模块，适用于基于图像的MLLMs。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive performance on instruction-following tasks by integrating pretrained
visual encoders with large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches
often struggle to ground fine-grained visual concepts in complex scenes. In
this paper, we propose MoDA (Modulation Adapter), a lightweight yet effective
module designed to refine pre-aligned visual features through
instruction-guided modulation. Our approach follows the standard LLaVA training
protocol, consisting of a two-stage process: (1) aligning image features to the
LLMs input space via a frozen vision encoder and adapter layers, and (2)
refining those features using the MoDA adapter during the instructional tuning
stage. MoDA employs a Transformer-based cross-attention mechanism to generate a
modulation mask over the aligned visual tokens, thereby emphasizing
semantically relevant embedding dimensions based on the language instruction.
The modulated features are then passed to the LLM for autoregressive language
generation. Our experimental evaluation shows that MoDA improves visual
grounding and generates more contextually appropriate responses, demonstrating
its effectiveness as a general-purpose enhancement for image-based MLLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出ShapeLLM-Omni，一种原生3D大语言模型，填补了ChatGPT-4o在3D内容理解与生成上的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型如ChatGPT-4o的多模态能力仅限于图像和文本，而3D内容的理解与生成同样重要。

Method: 1. 训练3D VQVAE以离散化表示3D对象；2. 构建3D-Alpaca数据集；3. 基于指令微调Qwen-2.5-vl-7B-Instruct模型。

Result: ShapeLLM-Omni实现了3D内容与文本的多模态交互，为3D-AI研究提供了基础。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了多模态模型的3D能力，为未来3D原生AI研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recently, the powerful text-to-image capabilities of ChatGPT-4o have led to
growing appreciation for native multimodal large language models. However, its
multimodal capabilities remain confined to images and text. Yet beyond images,
the ability to understand and generate 3D content is equally crucial. To
address this gap, we propose ShapeLLM-Omni-a native 3D large language model
capable of understanding and generating 3D assets and text in any sequence.
First, we train a 3D vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQVAE), which
maps 3D objects into a discrete latent space to achieve efficient and accurate
shape representation and reconstruction. Building upon the 3D-aware discrete
tokens, we innovatively construct a large-scale continuous training dataset
named 3D-Alpaca, encompassing generation, comprehension, and editing, thus
providing rich resources for future research and training. Finally, by
performing instruction-based training of the Qwen-2.5-vl-7B-Instruct model on
the 3D-Alpaca dataset. Our work provides an effective attempt at extending
multimodal models with basic 3D capabilities, which contributes to future
research in 3D-native AI. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“扰动报告判别”的新方法，用于预训练生物医学视觉语言模型，解决了生物医学文本复杂语义被忽视的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学文本具有复杂且领域特定的语义，现有对比学习方法常忽视这些特性。

Method: 通过文本扰动方法破坏句子语义结构，训练模型区分原始报告与扰动报告，同时对比图像子区域和文本子词。

Result: 在多个下游任务中表现优于基线方法，学习到更具语义意义和鲁棒性的多模态表示。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效捕捉生物医学文本的复杂语义，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models pre-trained on large scale of unlabeled biomedical
images and associated reports learn generalizable semantic representations.
These multi-modal representations can benefit various downstream tasks in the
biomedical domain. Contrastive learning is widely used to pre-train
vision-language models for general natural images and associated captions.
Despite its popularity, we found biomedical texts have complex and
domain-specific semantics that are often neglected by common contrastive
methods. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, perturbed report
discrimination, for pre-train biomedical vision-language models. First, we
curate a set of text perturbation methods that keep the same words, but disrupt
the semantic structure of the sentence. Next, we apply different types of
perturbation to reports, and use the model to distinguish the original report
from the perturbed ones given the associated image. Parallel to this, we
enhance the sensitivity of our method to higher level of granularity for both
modalities by contrasting attention-weighted image sub-regions and sub-words in
the image-text pairs. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple downstream
tasks, and our method outperforms strong baseline methods. The results
demonstrate that our approach learns more semantic meaningful and robust
multi-modal representations.

Motivation: 解决复杂语义和长时依赖的视频理解问题，利用RLT增强MLLMs的推理能力。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）框架，设计双奖励机制（离散和连续奖励），并提出基于重复推理的方差感知数据选择策略。

Result: 在八个视频理解任务中表现优于监督微调和现有RLT基线，且训练数据需求更少。

Conclusion: 奖励设计和数据选择对提升MLLMs的视频推理能力至关重要，代码已更新并开源。

Abstract: Understanding real-world videos with complex semantics and long temporal
dependencies remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Recent
progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated strong
capabilities in vision-language tasks, while reinforcement learning tuning
(RLT) has further improved their reasoning abilities. In this work, we explore
RLT as a post-training strategy to enhance the video-specific reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. Built upon the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
framework, we propose a dual-reward formulation that supervises both semantic
and temporal reasoning through discrete and continuous reward signals. To
facilitate effective preference-based optimization, we introduce a
variance-aware data selection strategy based on repeated inference to identify
samples that provide informative learning signals. We evaluate our approach
across eight representative video understanding tasks, including VideoQA,
Temporal Video Grounding, and Grounded VideoQA. Our method consistently
outperforms supervised fine-tuning and existing RLT baselines, achieving
superior performance with significantly less training data. These results
underscore the importance of reward design and data selection in advancing
reasoning-centric video understanding with MLLMs. Notably, The initial code
release (two months ago) has now been expanded with updates, including
optimized reward mechanisms and additional datasets. The latest version is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型在图像生成上表现优异，但其内部机制尚不明确，本文旨在揭示UNet降噪网络的内部表示和计算方式。

Method: 通过分析UNet的中间块，发现图像被分解为稀疏通道，并开发了一种基于这些通道空间平均值的随机重建算法。

Result: 实验表明，该算法能从目标图像表示中重建图像，且潜在空间中的欧氏距离与图像语义相似性相关。

Conclusion: 研究表明，仅通过降噪训练的UNet网络包含了丰富且可访问的稀疏图像表示。

Abstract: Generative diffusion models learn probability densities over diverse image
datasets by estimating the score with a neural network trained to remove noise.
Despite their remarkable success in generating high-quality images, the
internal mechanisms of the underlying score networks are not well understood.
Here, we examine a UNet trained for denoising on the ImageNet dataset, to
better understand its internal representation and computation of the score. We
show that the middle block of the UNet decomposes individual images into sparse
subsets of active channels, and that the vector of spatial averages of these
channels can provide a nonlinear representation of the underlying clean images.
We develop a novel algorithm for stochastic reconstruction of images from this
representation and demonstrate that it recovers a sample from a set of images
defined by a target image representation. We then study the properties of the
representation and demonstrate that Euclidean distances in the latent space
correspond to distances between conditional densities induced by
representations as well as semantic similarities in the image space. Applying a
clustering algorithm in the representation space yields groups of images that
share both fine details (e.g., specialized features, textured regions, small
objects), as well as global structure, but are only partially aligned with
object identities. Thus, we show for the first time that a network trained
solely on denoising contains a rich and accessible sparse representation of
images.

attention maps and ROIs to identify mislocalization. MedEBench provides a solid
foundation for developing and evaluating reliable, clinically meaningful

TL;DR: TaxaDiffusion是一种基于分类学知识的扩散模型训练框架，用于生成高保真度的细粒度动物图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将每个物种视为独立类别，忽略了物种间的视觉相似性。TaxaDiffusion利用分类学层次结构，从粗到细逐步训练模型，以提升生成准确性。

Method: TaxaDiffusion通过从大类（如纲、目）到细类（如科、属、种）的层次化训练，逐步捕捉形态特征，实现知识迁移和细粒度区分。

Result: 在三个细粒度动物数据集上的实验表明，TaxaDiffusion优于现有方法，生成图像具有更高的保真度。

Conclusion: TaxaDiffusion通过结合分类学知识，显著提升了细粒度动物图像生成的准确性和效率。

Abstract: We propose TaxaDiffusion, a taxonomy-informed training framework for
diffusion models to generate fine-grained animal images with high morphological
and identity accuracy. Unlike standard approaches that treat each species as an
independent category, TaxaDiffusion incorporates domain knowledge that many
species exhibit strong visual similarities, with distinctions often residing in
subtle variations of shape, pattern, and color. To exploit these relationships,
TaxaDiffusion progressively trains conditioned diffusion models across
different taxonomic levels -- starting from broad classifications such as Class
and Order, refining through Family and Genus, and ultimately distinguishing at
the Species level. This hierarchical learning strategy first captures
coarse-grained morphological traits shared by species with common ancestors,
facilitating knowledge transfer before refining fine-grained differences for
species-level distinction. As a result, TaxaDiffusion enables accurate
generation even with limited training samples per species. Extensive
experiments on three fine-grained animal datasets demonstrate that outperforms
existing approaches, achieving superior fidelity in fine-grained animal image
generation. Project page: https://amink8.github.io/TaxaDiffusion/

Abstract: Spatial intelligence, encompassing 3D reconstruction, perception, and
reasoning, is fundamental to applications such as robotics, aerial imaging, and
extended reality. A key enabler is the real-time, accurate estimation of core
3D attributes (camera parameters, point clouds, depth maps, and 3D point
tracks) from unstructured or streaming imagery. Inspired by the success of
large foundation models in language and 2D vision, a new class of end-to-end 3D
geometric foundation models (GFMs) has emerged, directly predicting dense 3D
representations in a single feed-forward pass, eliminating the need for slow or
unavailable precomputed camera parameters. Since late 2023, the field has
exploded with diverse variants, but systematic evaluation is lacking. In this
work, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for 3D GFMs, covering five
core tasks: sparse-view depth estimation, video depth estimation, 3D
reconstruction, multi-view pose estimation, novel view synthesis, and spanning
both standard and challenging out-of-distribution datasets. Our standardized
toolkit automates dataset handling, evaluation protocols, and metric
computation to ensure fair, reproducible comparisons. We evaluate 16
state-of-the-art GFMs, revealing their strengths and limitations across tasks
and domains, and derive key insights to guide future model scaling and
optimization. All code, evaluation scripts, and processed data will be publicly
released to accelerate research in 3D spatial intelligence.

Conclusion: 方法有效且高效，代码、模型和数据集将公开。

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for low-rank personalization of a generic model
for head avatar generation. Prior work proposes generic models that achieve
high-quality face animation by leveraging large-scale datasets of multiple
identities. However, such generic models usually fail to synthesize unique
identity-specific details, since they learn a general domain prior. To adapt to
specific subjects, we find that it is still challenging to capture
high-frequency facial details via popular solutions like low-rank adaptation
(LoRA). This motivates us to propose a specific architecture, a Register
Module, that enhances the performance of LoRA, while requiring only a small
number of parameters to adapt to an unseen identity. Our module is applied to
intermediate features of a pre-trained model, storing and re-purposing
information in a learnable 3D feature space. To demonstrate the efficacy of our
personalization method, we collect a dataset of talking videos of individuals
with distinctive facial details, such as wrinkles and tattoos. Our approach
faithfully captures unseen faces, outperforming existing methods quantitatively
and qualitatively. We will release the code, models, and dataset to the public.

Result: 在公开的结构从运动数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了全局最优性、鲁棒性和效率，为各向异性旋转平均问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Anisotropic rotation averaging has recently been explored as a natural
extension of respective isotropic methods. In the anisotropic formulation,
uncertainties of the estimated relative rotations -- obtained via standard
two-view optimization -- are propagated to the optimization of absolute
rotations. The resulting semidefinite relaxations are able to recover global
minima but scale poorly with the problem size. Local methods are fast and also
admit robust estimation but are sensitive to initialization. They usually
employ minimum spanning trees and therefore suffer from drift accumulation and
can get trapped in poor local minima. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the
gap between optimality, robustness and efficiency of anisotropic rotation
averaging. We analyze a family of block coordinate descent methods initially
proposed to optimize the standard chordal distances, and derive a much simpler
formulation and an anisotropic extension obtaining a fast general solver. We
integrate this solver into the extended anisotropic large-scale robust rotation
averaging pipeline. The resulting algorithm achieves state-of-the-art
performance on public structure-from-motion datasets. Project page:

TL;DR: OD3是一种针对目标检测的无优化数据蒸馏框架，通过候选选择和筛选两阶段方法，显著提升了数据集压缩后的检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模神经网络训练中计算资源需求高的问题，尤其是在目标检测任务中，现有数据集蒸馏方法主要针对图像分类，检测领域研究较少。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 候选选择，迭代放置对象实例；2) 候选筛选，使用预训练观察模型去除低置信度对象。

Result: 在MS COCO和PASCAL VOC数据集上，压缩比为0.25%至5%时，OD3优于现有方法，COCO mAP50提升超过14%。

Conclusion: OD3为目标检测任务提供了一种高效的数据蒸馏方法，显著提升了压缩数据集上的检测性能。

Abstract: Training large neural networks on large-scale datasets requires substantial
computational resources, particularly for dense prediction tasks such as object
detection. Although dataset distillation (DD) has been proposed to alleviate
these demands by synthesizing compact datasets from larger ones, most existing
work focuses solely on image classification, leaving the more complex detection
setting largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce OD3, a novel
optimization-free data distillation framework specifically designed for object
detection. Our approach involves two stages: first, a candidate selection
process in which object instances are iteratively placed in synthesized images
based on their suitable locations, and second, a candidate screening process
using a pre-trained observer model to remove low-confidence objects. We perform
our data synthesis framework on MS COCO and PASCAL VOC, two popular detection
datasets, with compression ratios ranging from 0.25% to 5%. Compared to the
prior solely existing dataset distillation method on detection and conventional
core set selection methods, OD3 delivers superior accuracy, establishes new
state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior best method by more than 14% on COCO
mAP50 at a compression ratio of 1.0%. Code and condensed datasets are available

Motivation: 现有轨迹方法主要关注单个物体运动，难以捕捉复杂机器人操作中多物体交互的关键动态，导致视觉保真度下降。

Method: 将交互过程分解为三个阶段（交互前、交互中、交互后），分别用主导物体特征建模，并引入外观和形状感知的潜在表示以确保语义一致性。

Result: 在Bridge V2数据集和实际评估中，RoboMaster表现优于现有方法，成为轨迹控制视频生成的新标杆。

Conclusion: RoboMaster通过分阶段建模和潜在表示，有效解决了多物体交互问题，提升了轨迹控制视频生成的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential
for generating robotic decision-making data, with trajectory conditions further
enabling fine-grained control. However, existing trajectory-based methods
primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture
multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This
limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which
leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a
novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative
trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core
is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction,
interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of
the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and
post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby
mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during
interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency
throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent
representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2
dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance
in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Recent advances in scene understanding have leveraged multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) for 3D reasoning by capitalizing on their strong 2D
pretraining. However, the lack of explicit 3D data during MLLM pretraining
limits 3D representation capability. In this paper, we investigate the
3D-awareness of MLLMs by evaluating multi-view correspondence and reveal a
strong positive correlation between the quality of 3D-aware representation and
downstream task performance. Motivated by this, we propose 3DRS, a framework
that enhances MLLM 3D representation learning by introducing supervision from
pretrained 3D foundation models. Our approach aligns MLLM visual features with
rich 3D knowledge distilled from 3D models, effectively improving scene
understanding. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and MLLMs --
including visual grounding, captioning, and question answering -- demonstrate
consistent performance gains. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/3drs

Abstract: Numerous low-level vision tasks operate in the RAW domain due to its linear
properties, bit depth, and sensor designs. Despite this, RAW image datasets are
scarce and more expensive to collect than the already large and public sRGB
datasets. For this reason, many approaches try to generate realistic RAW images
using sensor information and sRGB images. This paper covers the second
challenge on RAW Reconstruction from sRGB (Reverse ISP). We aim to recover RAW
sensor images from smartphones given the corresponding sRGB images without
metadata and, by doing this, ``reverse" the ISP transformation. Over 150
participants joined this NTIRE 2025 challenge and submitted efficient models.
The proposed methods and benchmark establish the state-of-the-art for

Conclusion: IMAGHarmony通过创新的框架和策略，显著提升了多对象图像编辑的性能，为复杂场景的编辑提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent diffusion models have advanced image editing by enhancing visual
quality and control, supporting broad applications across creative and
personalized domains. However, current image editing largely overlooks
multi-object scenarios, where precise control over object categories, counts,
and spatial layouts remains a significant challenge. To address this, we
introduce a new task, quantity-and-layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit),
which aims to enable fine-grained control of object quantity and spatial
structure in complex scenes. We further propose IMAGHarmony, a structure-aware
framework that incorporates harmony-aware attention (HA) to integrate
multimodal semantics, explicitly modeling object counts and layouts to enhance
editing accuracy and structural consistency. In addition, we observe that
diffusion models are susceptible to initial noise and exhibit strong
preferences for specific noise patterns. Motivated by this, we present a
preference-guided noise selection (PNS) strategy that chooses semantically
aligned initial noise samples based on vision-language matching, thereby
improving generation stability and layout consistency in multi-object editing.
To support evaluation, we construct HarmonyBench, a comprehensive benchmark
covering diverse quantity and layout control scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that IMAGHarmony consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in structural alignment and semantic accuracy. The code and model are available

to be taught new tasks. In contrast, vision-language models, or VLMs, can learn
tasks in-context and produce the correct outputs for a given input. We propose
a dual-process distillation scheme that allows feed-forward image generators to
learn new tasks from deliberative VLMs. Our scheme uses a VLM to rate the
generated images and backpropagates this gradient to update the weights of the
image generator. Our general framework enables a wide variety of new control
tasks through the same text-and-image based interface. We showcase a handful of
applications of this technique for different types of control signals, such as
commonsense inferences and visual prompts. With our method, users can implement
multimodal controls for properties such as color palette, line weight, horizon
position, and relative depth within a matter of minutes. Project page:

### [507] [Designing AI Tools for Clinical Care Teams to Support Serious Illness Conversations with Older Adults in the Emergency Department](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00241)
*Menglin Zhao,Zhuorui Yong,Ruijia Guan,Kai-Wei Chang,Adrian Haimovich,Kei Ouchi,Timothy Bickmore,Bingsheng Yao,Dakuo Wang,Smit Desai*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文探讨了急诊科（ED）中与老年患者进行严重疾病对话（SICs）的挑战，并提出了AI工具支持的需求和设计指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 严重疾病对话对患者为中心的治疗至关重要，但急诊科中老年患者缺乏相关记录，临床团队面临多重障碍。

Method: 通过访谈两位领域专家和九位急诊科临床团队成员，进行主题分析，总结出四阶段工作流程。

Result: 研究发现临床团队在数据访问、时间限制、情感准备和文档负担方面存在困难，但对AI工具支持持开放态度。

Conclusion: 论文提出了支持SIC工作流程的AI设计指南，强调保持人际联系和临床自主性。

Abstract: Serious illness conversations (SICs), discussions between clinical care teams
and patients with serious, life-limiting illnesses about their values, goals,
and care preferences, are critical for patient-centered care. Without these
conversations, patients often receive aggressive interventions that may not
align with their goals. Clinical care teams face significant barriers when
conducting serious illness conversations with older adult patients in Emergency
Department (ED) settings, where most older adult patients lack documented
treatment goals. To understand current practices and identify AI support
opportunities, we conducted interviews with two domain experts and nine ED
clinical care team members. Through thematic analysis, we characterized a
four-phase serious illness conversation workflow (identification, preparation,
conduction, documentation) and identified key needs and challenges at each
stage. Clinical care teams struggle with fragmented EHR data access, time
constraints, emotional preparation demands, and documentation burdens. While
participants expressed interest in AI tools for information synthesis,
conversational support, and automated documentation, they emphasized preserving
human connection and clinical autonomy. We present design guidelines for AI
tools supporting SIC workflows that fit within existing clinical practices.
This work contributes empirical understanding of ED-based serious illness
conversations and provides design considerations for AI in high-stakes clinical
environments.

TL;DR: Vid2Coach是一个将教学视频转化为可穿戴设备辅助工具的系统，帮助盲人和低视力人群通过详细描述和非视觉解决方案完成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 盲人和低视力人群难以通过视频学习，依赖视觉康复治疗师的帮助。Vid2Coach旨在提供类似的支持。

Method: 系统从视频生成详细指令，结合非视觉解决方案，并通过智能眼镜监控用户进度，提供反馈。

Result: 使用Vid2Coach的参与者错误率降低了58.5%，并希望将其融入日常生活。

Conclusion: Vid2Coach展示了AI视觉辅助的潜力，能够增强而非取代非视觉专业知识。

Abstract: People use videos to learn new recipes, exercises, and crafts. Such videos
remain difficult for blind and low vision (BLV) people to follow as they rely
on visual comparison. Our observations of visual rehabilitation therapists
(VRTs) guiding BLV people to follow how-to videos revealed that VRTs provide
both proactive and responsive support including detailed descriptions,
non-visual workarounds, and progress feedback. We propose Vid2Coach, a system
that transforms how-to videos into wearable camera-based assistants that
provide accessible instructions and mixed-initiative feedback. From the video,
Vid2Coach generates accessible instructions by augmenting narrated instructions
with demonstration details and completion criteria for each step. It then uses
retrieval-augmented-generation to extract relevant non-visual workarounds from
BLV-specific resources. Vid2Coach then monitors user progress with a camera
embedded in commercial smart glasses to provide context-aware instructions,
proactive feedback, and answers to user questions. BLV participants (N=8) using
Vid2Coach completed cooking tasks with 58.5\% fewer errors than when using
their typical workflow and wanted to use Vid2Coach in their daily lives.
Vid2Coach demonstrates an opportunity for AI visual assistance that strengthens
rather than replaces non-visual expertise.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: HGBA是首个针对异构图神经网络的隐蔽后门攻击方法，通过关系型触发机制和低预算攻击实现高效攻击，并改进了攻击效果评估协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究异构图神经网络（HGNNs）对后门攻击的脆弱性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出HGBA方法，采用关系型触发机制和两种灵活的攻击策略（自节点攻击和无差别攻击），并改进ASR测量协议。

Result: HGBA在低预算下高效攻击HGNNs，优于现有方法，且对防御机制和特征扰动具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HGBA不仅威胁HGNNs，还能扩展到同构图任务，对安全关键领域构成严重威胁。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) excel in modeling complex,
multi-typed relationships across diverse domains, yet their vulnerability to
backdoor attacks remains unexplored. To address this gap, we conduct the first
investigation into the susceptibility of HGNNs to existing graph backdoor
attacks, revealing three critical issues: (1) high attack budget required for
effective backdoor injection, (2) inefficient and unreliable backdoor
activation, and (3) inaccurate attack effectiveness evaluation. To tackle these
issues, we propose the Heterogeneous Graph Backdoor Attack (HGBA), the first
backdoor attack specifically designed for HGNNs, introducing a novel
relation-based trigger mechanism that establishes specific connections between
a strategically selected trigger node and poisoned nodes via the backdoor
metapath. HGBA achieves efficient and stealthy backdoor injection with minimal
structural modifications and supports easy backdoor activation through two
flexible strategies: Self-Node Attack and Indiscriminate Attack. Additionally,
we improve the ASR measurement protocol, enabling a more accurate assessment of
attack effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HGBA far surpasses
multiple state-of-the-art graph backdoor attacks in black-box settings,
efficiently attacking HGNNs with low attack budgets. Ablation studies show that
the strength of HBGA benefits from our trigger node selection method and
backdoor metapath selection strategy. In addition, HGBA shows superior
robustness against node feature perturbations and multiple types of existing
graph backdoor defense mechanisms. Finally, extension experiments demonstrate
that the relation-based trigger mechanism can effectively extend to tasks in
homogeneous graph scenarios, thereby posing severe threats to broader
security-critical domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在数字取证中的应用前景广阔，但缺乏透明度、可解释性和可重复性阻碍了其广泛采用。

Method: 通过理论分析，探讨MCP如何整合到多种取证场景中，并提出了技术及概念上的部署考虑。

Result: MCP不仅能增强现有取证流程，还能扩展LLM的应用范围，同时通过推理约束级别提升可审计性和可追溯性。

Conclusion: MCP作为LLM辅助取证的基础组件潜力巨大，但也面临未来可能带来的挑战。

Abstract: Large language models hold considerable promise for supporting forensic
investigations, but their widespread adoption is hindered by a lack of
transparency, explainability, and reproducibility. This paper explores how the
emerging Model Context Protocol can address these challenges and support the
meaningful use of LLMs in digital forensics. Through a theoretical analysis, we
examine how MCP can be integrated across various forensic scenarios - ranging
from artifact analysis to the generation of interpretable reports. We also
outline both technical and conceptual considerations for deploying an MCP
server in forensic environments. Our analysis reveals a wide range of use cases
in which MCP not only strengthens existing forensic workflows but also
facilitates the application of LLMs to areas of forensics where their use was
previously limited. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of the inference
constraint level - a way of characterizing how specific MCP design choices can
deliberately constrain model behavior, thereby enhancing both auditability and
traceability. Our insights demonstrate that MCP has significant potential as a
foundational component for developing LLM-assisted forensic workflows that are
not only more transparent, reproducible, and legally defensible, but also
represent a step toward increased automation in digital forensic analysis.
However, we also highlight potential challenges that the adoption of MCP may
pose for digital forensics in the future.

Result: 成功实现针对多阶段目标检测器（如Faster R-CNN）的对抗攻击，展示了3DGS的新威胁。

Abstract: With 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) being increasingly used in safety-critical
applications, how can an adversary manipulate the scene to cause harm? We
introduce CLOAK, the first attack that leverages view-dependent Gaussian
appearances - colors and textures that change with viewing angle - to embed
adversarial content visible only from specific viewpoints. We further
demonstrate DAGGER, a targeted adversarial attack directly perturbing 3D
Gaussians without access to underlying training data, deceiving multi-stage
object detectors e.g., Faster R-CNN, through established methods such as
projected gradient descent. These attacks highlight underexplored
vulnerabilities in 3DGS, introducing a new potential threat to robotic learning

Motivation: 研究主流VLP的安全影响，填补其在视觉语言模型（LVLM）安全性方面的研究空白。

Method: 对压缩和未经压缩的VLP进行综合评估，分析其安全特性。

Result: 压缩型VLP易受攻击，而未经压缩的VLP安全性更强。

Conclusion: 未经压缩的VLP更适合提升视觉语言模型的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: The choice of a suitable visual language projector (VLP) is critical to the
successful training of large visual language models (LVLMs). Mainstream VLPs
can be broadly categorized into compressed and uncompressed projectors, and
each offering distinct advantages in performance and computational efficiency.
However, their security implications have not been thoroughly examined. Our
comprehensive evaluation reveals significant differences in their security
profiles: compressed projectors exhibit substantial vulnerabilities, allowing
adversaries to successfully compromise LVLMs even with minimal knowledge of
structural information. In stark contrast, uncompressed projectors demonstrate
robust security properties and do not introduce additional vulnerabilities.
These findings provide critical guidance for researchers in selecting optimal
VLPs that enhance the security and reliability of visual language models. The
code will be released.

Motivation: 尽管GFMs在变异效应预测中表现优异，但其对抗鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 采用Fast Gradient Sign Method（FGSM）和软提示攻击两种方法评估GFMs的对抗脆弱性。

Result: 软提示攻击导致ESM1b和ESM1v等大型模型性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了GFMs的安全漏洞，为提升其在高风险基因组应用中的鲁棒性提供了新方向。

Abstract: Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs), such as Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM),
have demonstrated significant success in variant effect prediction. However,
their adversarial robustness remains largely unexplored. To address this gap,
we propose SafeGenes: a framework for Secure analysis of genomic foundation
models, leveraging adversarial attacks to evaluate robustness against both
engineered near-identical adversarial Genes and embedding-space manipulations.
In this study, we assess the adversarial vulnerabilities of GFMs using two
approaches: the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and a soft prompt attack. FGSM
introduces minimal perturbations to input sequences, while the soft prompt
attack optimizes continuous embeddings to manipulate model predictions without
modifying the input tokens. By combining these techniques, SafeGenes provides a
comprehensive assessment of GFM susceptibility to adversarial manipulation.
Targeted soft prompt attacks led to substantial performance degradation, even
in large models such as ESM1b and ESM1v. These findings expose critical
vulnerabilities in current foundation models, opening new research directions
toward improving their security and robustness in high-stakes genomic
applications such as variant effect prediction.

Motivation: 现有交通CPS威胁建模框架范围有限、资源密集且依赖专家知识，TraCR-TMF旨在填补这些空白。

Method: TraCR-TMF利用MITRE ATT&CK矩阵，通过三种LLM方法（无专家输入的RAG、低专家输入的上下文学习、中等专家输入的监督微调）识别威胁和应对措施。

Result: 在两种场景下验证：识别攻击技术（90%精确度）和预测真实网络攻击事件中的多种利用行为。

Conclusion: TraCR-TMF在CPS威胁建模中有效，减少对专家知识的依赖，并具有跨领域的适应性。

Abstract: Modern transportation systems rely on cyber-physical systems (CPS), where
cyber systems interact seamlessly with physical systems like
transportation-related sensors and actuators to enhance safety, mobility, and
energy efficiency. However, growing automation and connectivity increase
exposure to cyber vulnerabilities. Existing threat modeling frameworks for
transportation CPS are often limited in scope, resource-intensive, and
dependent on significant cybersecurity expertise. To address these gaps, we
present TraCR-TMF (Transportation Cybersecurity and Resiliency Threat Modeling
Framework), a large language model (LLM)-based framework that minimizes expert
intervention. TraCR-TMF identifies threats, potential attack techniques, and
corresponding countermeasures by leveraging the MITRE ATT&CK matrix through
three LLM-based approaches: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method
requiring no expert input, (ii) an in-context learning approach requiring low
expert input, and (iii) a supervised fine-tuning method requiring moderate
expert input. TraCR-TMF also maps attack paths to critical assets by analyzing
vulnerabilities using a customized LLM. The framework was evaluated in two
scenarios. First, it identified relevant attack techniques across
transportation CPS applications, with 90% precision as validated by experts.
Second, using a fine-tuned LLM, it successfully predicted multiple
exploitations including lateral movement, data exfiltration, and
ransomware-related encryption that occurred during a major real-world
cyberattack incident. These results demonstrate TraCR-TMF's effectiveness in
CPS threat modeling, its reduced reliance on cybersecurity expertise, and its
adaptability across CPS domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击多依赖文本指令和对抗性图像，而本文利用MLLMs对非文本指令的理解能力，揭示其潜在安全隐患。

Method: 优化对抗性示例以在嵌入空间中与目标指令对齐，引入ARC框架评估攻击效果。

Result: 在LLaVA-v1.5等模型上攻击成功率最高达86.6%，并发现现有防御技术存在性能差距。

Conclusion: Con Instruction有效暴露MLLMs的安全漏洞，为防御研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Existing attacks against multimodal language models (MLLMs) primarily
communicate instructions through text accompanied by adversarial images. In
contrast, we exploit the capabilities of MLLMs to interpret non-textual
instructions, specifically, adversarial images or audio generated by our novel
method, Con Instruction. We optimize these adversarial examples to align
closely with target instructions in the embedding space, revealing the
detrimental implications of MLLMs' sophisticated understanding. Unlike prior
work, our method does not require training data or preprocessing of textual
instructions. While these non-textual adversarial examples can effectively
bypass MLLM safety mechanisms, their combination with various text inputs
substantially amplifies attack success. We further introduce a new Attack
Response Categorization (ARC) framework, which evaluates both the quality of
the model's response and its relevance to the malicious instructions.
Experimental results demonstrate that Con Instruction effectively bypasses
safety mechanisms in multiple vision- and audio-language models, including
LLaVA-v1.5, InternVL, Qwen-VL, and Qwen-Audio, evaluated on two standard
benchmarks: AdvBench and SafeBench. Specifically, our method achieves the
highest attack success rates, reaching 81.3% and 86.6% on LLaVA-v1.5 (13B). On
the defense side, we explore various countermeasures against our attacks and
uncover a substantial performance gap among existing techniques. Our
implementation is made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有基准测试对复杂威胁（如数据泄露）研究不足，需深入探讨提示注入攻击对代理安全的影响。

Method: 开发基于数据流的攻击方法，集成到AgentDojo基准测试中，并使用合成数据集模拟人机银行对话。

Result: 攻击下LLM效用下降15-50%，平均攻击成功率约20%；密码泄露概率低，但其他个人数据易泄露。

Conclusion: 任务类型与防御效果密切相关，现有防御无法完全防止数据泄露，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Previous benchmarks on prompt injection in large language models (LLMs) have
primarily focused on generic tasks and attacks, offering limited insights into
more complex threats like data exfiltration. This paper examines how prompt
injection can cause tool-calling agents to leak personal data observed during
task execution. Using a fictitious banking agent, we develop data flow-based
attacks and integrate them into AgentDojo, a recent benchmark for agentic
security. To enhance its scope, we also create a richer synthetic dataset of
human-AI banking conversations. In 16 user tasks from AgentDojo, LLMs show a
15-50 percentage point drop in utility under attack, with average attack
success rates (ASR) around 20 percent; some defenses reduce ASR to zero. Most
LLMs, even when successfully tricked by the attack, avoid leaking highly
sensitive data like passwords, likely due to safety alignments, but they remain
vulnerable to disclosing other personal data. The likelihood of password
leakage increases when a password is requested along with one or two additional
personal details. In an extended evaluation across 48 tasks, the average ASR is
around 15 percent, with no built-in AgentDojo defense fully preventing leakage.
Tasks involving data extraction or authorization workflows, which closely
resemble the structure of exfiltration attacks, exhibit the highest ASRs,
highlighting the interaction between task type, agent performance, and defense
efficacy.

Abstract: Graph-based frameworks are often used in network hardening to help a cyber
defender understand how a network can be attacked and how the best defenses can
be deployed. However, incorporating network connectivity parameters in the
attack graph, reasoning about the attack graph when we do not have access to
complete information, providing system administrator suggestions in an
understandable format, and allowing them to do what-if analysis on various
scenarios and attacker motives is still missing. We fill this gap by presenting
SPEAR, a formal framework with tool support for security posture evaluation and
analysis that keeps human-in-the-loop. SPEAR uses the causal formalism of AI
planning to model vulnerabilities and configurations in a networked system. It
automatically converts network configurations and vulnerability descriptions
into planning models expressed in the Planning Domain Definition Language
(PDDL). SPEAR identifies a set of diverse security hardening strategies that
can be presented in a manner understandable to the domain expert. These allow
the administrator to explore the network hardening solution space in a
systematic fashion and help evaluate the impact and compare the different
solutions.

Result: 实验表明，多模态通用越狱攻击能生成更高质量的不良内容，并揭示了当前安全机制的不足。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁加强MLLMs的安全措施，以应对多模态能力带来的潜在风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), significantly enhancing their capabilities by integrating
visual information and other types, thus aligning more closely with the nature
of human intelligence, which processes a variety of data forms beyond just
text. Despite advancements, the undesirable generation of these models remains
a critical concern, particularly due to vulnerabilities exposed by text-based
jailbreak attacks, which have represented a significant threat by challenging
existing safety protocols. Motivated by the unique security risks posed by the
integration of new and old modalities for MLLMs, we propose a unified
multimodal universal jailbreak attack framework that leverages iterative
image-text interactions and transfer-based strategy to generate a universal
adversarial suffix and image. Our work not only highlights the interaction of
image-text modalities can be used as a critical vulnerability but also
validates that multimodal universal jailbreak attacks can bring higher-quality
undesirable generations across different MLLMs. We evaluate the undesirable
context generation of MLLMs like LLaVA, Yi-VL, MiniGPT4, MiniGPT-v2, and
InstructBLIP, and reveal significant multimodal safety alignment issues,
highlighting the inadequacy of current safety mechanisms against sophisticated
multimodal attacks. This study underscores the urgent need for robust safety
measures in MLLMs, advocating for a comprehensive review and enhancement of
security protocols to mitigate potential risks associated with multimodal
capabilities.

Method: 引入ETDI，结合加密验证、不可变工具定义、OAuth 2.0权限管理，并扩展细粒度策略访问控制。

Result: ETDI通过动态策略评估和运行时上下文，提供更安全、可控的LLM与工具交互环境。

Conclusion: ETDI为MCP提供了多层次安全防护，有望构建更可靠的AI应用生态系统。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) plays a crucial role in extending the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling integration with
external tools and data sources. However, the standard MCP specification
presents significant security vulnerabilities, notably Tool Poisoning and Rug
Pull attacks. This paper introduces the Enhanced Tool Definition Interface
(ETDI), a security extension designed to fortify MCP. ETDI incorporates
cryptographic identity verification, immutable versioned tool definitions, and
explicit permission management, often leveraging OAuth 2.0. We further propose
extending MCP with fine-grained, policy-based access control, where tool
capabilities are dynamically evaluated against explicit policies using a
dedicated policy engine, considering runtime context beyond static OAuth
scopes. This layered approach aims to establish a more secure, trustworthy, and
controllable ecosystem for AI applications interacting with LLMs and external
tools.

Abstract: As malware continues to become more complex and harder to detect, Malware
Analysis needs to continue to evolve to stay one step ahead. One promising key
area approach focuses on using system calls and API Calls, the core
communication between user applications and the operating system and their
kernels. These calls provide valuable insight into how software or programs
behaves, making them an useful tool for spotting suspicious or harmful activity
of programs and software. This chapter takes a deep down look at how system
calls are used in malware detection and classification, covering techniques
like static and dynamic analysis, as well as sandboxing. By combining these
methods with advanced techniques like machine learning, statistical analysis,
and anomaly detection, researchers can analyze system call patterns to tell the
difference between normal and malicious behavior. The chapter also explores how
these techniques are applied across different systems, including Windows,
Linux, and Android, while also looking at the ways sophisticated malware tries
to evade detection.

TL;DR: ReGA是一个基于模型的分析框架，通过表示引导的抽象技术解决LLMs的安全问题，显著提高了区分安全与有害输入的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在生成有害内容和易受越狱攻击方面存在安全风险，现有模型分析方法在扩展到LLMs时面临可扩展性问题。

Method: 利用安全关键表示（低维方向）构建抽象模型，结合表示工程和模型抽象技术。

Result: ReGA在提示级别和对话级别的AUROC分别达到0.975和0.985，对现实攻击具有鲁棒性，并在可解释性和可扩展性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReGA通过整合表示工程与模型抽象，为LLM安全提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，为AI安全开辟了新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various
tasks, yet concerns about their safety and security have emerged. In
particular, they pose risks in generating harmful content and vulnerability to
jailbreaking attacks. To analyze and monitor machine learning models,
model-based analysis has demonstrated notable potential in stateful deep neural
networks, yet suffers from scalability issues when extending to LLMs due to
their vast feature spaces. In this paper, we propose ReGA, a model-based
analysis framework with representation-guided abstraction, to safeguard LLMs
against harmful prompts and generations. By leveraging safety-critical
representations, which are low-dimensional directions emerging in hidden states
that indicate safety-related concepts, ReGA effectively addresses the
scalability issue when constructing the abstract model for safety modeling. Our
comprehensive evaluation shows that ReGA performs sufficiently well in
distinguishing between safe and harmful inputs, achieving an AUROC of 0.975 at
the prompt level and 0.985 at the conversation level. Additionally, ReGA
exhibits robustness to real-world attacks and generalization across different
safety perspectives, outperforming existing safeguard paradigms in terms of
interpretability and scalability. Overall, ReGA serves as an efficient and
scalable solution to enhance LLM safety by integrating representation
engineering with model-based abstraction, paving the way for new paradigms to
utilize software insights for AI safety. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用LLM（如MS Copilot）部分自动化软件架构评估活动，初步验证其效果优于人工评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统架构评估依赖人工，效率低且易冲突，希望通过LLM提升效率和准确性。

Method: 使用MS Copilot分析学生提出的质量场景，并与学生评估结果对比。

Result: LLM在大多数情况下能提供更准确的风险、敏感点和权衡分析。

Conclusion: 生成式AI可部分自动化架构评估，支持人类决策过程。

Abstract: Architecture evaluation methods have long been used to evaluate software
designs. Several evaluation methods have been proposed and used to analyze
tradeoffs between different quality attributes. Having competing qualities
leads to conflicts for selecting which quality-attribute scenarios are the most
suitable ones that an architecture should tackle and for prioritizing the
scenarios required by the stakeholders. In this context, architecture
evaluation is carried out manually, often involving long brainstorming sessions
to decide which are the most adequate quality scenarios. To reduce this effort
and make the assessment and selection of scenarios more efficient, we suggest
the usage of LLMs to partially automate evaluation activities. As a first step
to validate this hypothesis, this work studies MS Copilot as an LLM tool to
analyze quality scenarios suggested by students in a software architecture
course and compares the students' results with the assessment provided by the
LLM. Our initial study reveals that the LLM produces in most cases better and
more accurate results regarding the risks, sensitivity points and tradeoff
analysis of the quality scenarios. Overall, the use of generative AI has the
potential to partially automate and support the architecture evaluation tasks,
improving the human decision-making process.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RFCScan是一种利用大语言模型（LLM）检测网络协议实现与RFC规范一致性的自主代理工具，能高效识别功能错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 功能错误可能导致严重后果（如路由错误、认证绕过等），传统静态分析工具无法满足需求。

Method: RFCScan由索引代理和检测代理组成，前者生成语义索引，后者通过需求驱动检索识别不一致性。

Result: 在六个真实网络协议实现中，RFCScan识别出47个功能错误，精确率达81.9%，其中20个已被开发者确认或修复。

Conclusion: RFCScan通过结合LLM和分层语义分析，显著提升了功能错误检测的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Functional correctness is critical for ensuring the reliability and security
of network protocol implementations. Functional bugs, instances where
implementations diverge from behaviors specified in RFC documents, can lead to
severe consequences, including faulty routing, authentication bypasses, and
service disruptions. Detecting these bugs requires deep semantic analysis
across specification documents and source code, a task beyond the capabilities
of traditional static analysis tools. This paper introduces RFCScan, an
autonomous agent that leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect
functional bugs by checking conformance between network protocol
implementations and their RFC specifications. Inspired by the human auditing
procedure, RFCScan comprises two key components: an indexing agent and a
detection agent. The former hierarchically summarizes protocol code semantics,
generating semantic indexes that enable the detection agent to narrow down the
scanning scope. The latter employs demand-driven retrieval to iteratively
collect additional relevant data structures and functions, eventually
identifying potential inconsistencies with the RFC specifications effectively.
We evaluate RFCScan across six real-world network protocol implementations.
RFCScan identifies 47 functional bugs with 81.9% precision, of which 20 bugs
have been confirmed or fixed by developers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码推理基准多依赖合成数据或教育性问题，无法有效评估LLMs在实际软件工程任务中的表现。

Method: 从真实仓库收集Python、C和Java项目，执行测试并收集执行轨迹，构建细粒度语义推理任务的数据集，并对LLMs进行全面评估。

Result: LLMs在细粒度推理任务上表现不佳，提示技术虽有一定帮助，但缺乏代码语义理解能力仍是主要限制。

Conclusion: CodeSense为未来基准构建和模型训练提供了工具和数据集，揭示了LLMs在代码推理上的不足。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about code semantics is essential for enhancing
code LLMs' abilities to solve real-world software engineering (SE) tasks.
Although several code reasoning benchmarks exist, most rely on synthetic
datasets or educational coding problems and focus on coarse-grained reasoning
tasks such as input/output prediction, limiting their effectiveness in
evaluating LLMs in practical SE contexts. To bridge this gap, we propose
CodeSense, the first benchmark that makes available a spectrum of fine-grained
code reasoning tasks concerned with the software engineering of real-world
code. We collected Python, C and Java software projects from real-world
repositories. We executed tests from these repositories, collected their
execution traces, and constructed a ground truth dataset for fine-grained
semantic reasoning tasks. We then performed comprehensive evaluations on
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results show a clear performance gap for the models
to handle fine-grained reasoning tasks. Although prompting techniques such as
chain-of-thought and in-context learning helped, the lack of code semantics in
LLMs fundamentally limit models' capabilities of code reasoning. Besides
dataset, benchmark and evaluation, our work produced an execution tracing
framework and tool set that make it easy to collect ground truth for
fine-grained SE reasoning tasks, offering a strong basis for future benchmark
construction and model post training. Our code and data are located at

TL;DR: 研究评估了9种大型语言模型（LLM）在通过自然语言用例为无方法的UML类图生成行为方法时的表现，发现LLM能生成结构良好的方法，但需要人工监督以确保准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化从自然语言用例中为UML类图生成行为方法是一个重要挑战，研究旨在评估LLM在此任务中的表现。

Method: 使用21个结构化废物管理用例，评估9种LLM为包含21个类和17个关系的无方法UML图生成方法的能力，共生成90个图（3,373个方法），并基于6个指标进行评估。

Result: 所有LLM均能生成符合UML规范的PlantUML图，部分模型在方法覆盖率和注释准确性上表现优异，但签名和注释的一致性仍需改进。

Conclusion: LLM可作为软件设计中的协作工具，快速生成方法支持敏捷实践，但需人工监督以确保语义对齐和准确性。

Abstract: Automating the enrichment of UML class diagrams with behavioral methods from
natural language use cases is a significant challenge. This study evaluates
nine large language models (LLMs) in augmenting a methodless UML diagram (21
classes, 17 relationships) using 21 structured waste-management use cases. A
total of 90 diagrams (3,373 methods) were assessed across six metrics: method
quantity, signature richness (visibility, names, parameters, return types),
annotation completeness (linking to use cases/actions), structural fidelity,
syntactic correctness (PlantUML compilation), and naming convergence (across
models). All LLMs produced valid PlantUML diagrams adhering to UML conventions.
Some models excelled in method coverage and annotation accuracy, while others
showed richer parameterization but weaker traceability. These results
demonstrate that LLMs can generate well-structured methods with consistent
naming, advancing automated behavioral modeling. However, inconsistencies in
annotations and signatures highlight the need for improved prompt engineering
and model selection. The rapid generation of these methods supports Agile
practices by enabling faster design iterations. Despite their capabilities,
human oversight is essential to ensure accuracy, appropriateness, and semantic
alignment. This positions LLMs as collaborative partners in software design.
All experimental artifacts (\texttt{.puml}, \texttt{.png}, \texttt{.csv}) are

Result: LLMs的平均通过率为26.50%，GPT-4O表现最佳（43.84%）。发现LLMs更擅长处理新版本函数，但有时逻辑不一致。

Conclusion: CODEMENV为评估LLMs在代码迁移中的能力提供了有效工具，揭示了其优势和不足。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across
various software engineering tasks; however, their effectiveness in code
migration, adapting code to run in different environments, remains
insufficiently studied. In this work, we introduce CODEMENV: Code Migration
Across Environment, a new benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs'
abilities in code migration scenarios. CODEMENV consists of 922 examples
spanning 19 Python and Java packages, and covers three core tasks: (1)
identifying functions incompatible with specific versions, (2) detecting
changes in function definitions, and (3) adapting code to target environments.
Experimental evaluation with seven LLMs on CODEMENV yields an average pass@1
rate of 26.50%, with GPT-4O achieving the highest score at 43.84%. Key findings
include: (i) LLMs tend to be more proficient with newer function versions,
which aids in migrating legacy code, and (ii) LLMs sometimes exhibit logical
inconsistencies by identifying function changes irrelevant to the intended
migration environment. The datasets are available at

Motivation: 智能合约的法律合规性验证需要法律和软件开发双重专业知识，且现有方法依赖大量人工。LLM在代码生成上的进展为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 提出基于过程建模的合规性量化指标，选取四种LLM生成20个智能合约，分析其法律合规性。

Result: LLM生成的代码语法正确，但法律合规性差异显著，大模型表现更好。新指标能提供细粒度区分和跨领域适用性。

Conclusion: LLM可辅助生成合规智能合约的初始代码，但需严格审查；新指标为自动化开发流程奠定了基础。

Abstract: Smart contracts can implement and automate parts of legal contracts, but
ensuring their legal compliance remains challenging. Existing approaches such
as formal specification, verification, and model-based development require
expertise in both legal and software development domains, as well as extensive
manual effort. Given the recent advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
code generation, we investigate their ability to generate legally compliant
smart contracts directly from natural language legal contracts, addressing
these challenges. We propose a novel suite of metrics to quantify legal
compliance based on modeling both legal and smart contracts as processes and
comparing their behaviors. We select four LLMs, generate 20 smart contracts
based on five legal contracts, and analyze their legal compliance. We find that
while all LLMs generate syntactically correct code, there is significant
variance in their legal compliance with larger models generally showing higher
levels of compliance. We also evaluate the proposed metrics against properties
of software metrics, showing they provide fine-grained distinctions, enable
nuanced comparisons, and are applicable across domains for code from any
source, LLM or developer. Our results suggest that LLMs can assist in
generating starter code for legally compliant smart contracts with strict
reviews, and the proposed metrics provide a foundation for automated and
self-improving development workflows.

Conclusion: AI辅助MRI检测工具有潜力提高乳腺癌早期诊断效率，减轻放射科医生负担。

Abstract: Detecting breast cancer early is of the utmost importance to effectively
treat the millions of women afflicted by breast cancer worldwide every year.
Although mammography is the primary imaging modality for screening breast
cancer, there is an increasing interest in adding magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) to screening programmes, particularly for women at high risk. Recent
guidelines by the European Society of Breast Imaging (EUSOBI) recommended
breast MRI as a supplemental screening tool for women with dense breast tissue.
However, acquiring and reading MRI scans requires significantly more time from
expert radiologists. This highlights the need to develop new automated methods
to detect cancer accurately using MRI and Artificial Intelligence (AI), which
have the potential to support radiologists in breast MRI interpretation and
classification and help detect cancer earlier. For this reason, the ODELIA
consortium has made this multi-centre dataset publicly available to assist in
developing AI tools for the detection of breast cancer on MRI.

Result: 实验验证了该方法在定量指标和感知质量上的优异表现。

Conclusion: 该方法为多种图像恢复任务提供了统一的框架，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Noisy supervision refers to supervising image restoration learning with noisy
targets. It can alleviate the data collection burden and enhance the practical
applicability of deep learning techniques. However, existing methods suffer
from two key drawbacks. Firstly, they are ineffective in handling spatially
correlated noise commonly observed in practical applications such as low-light
imaging and remote sensing. Secondly, they rely on pixel-wise loss functions
that only provide limited supervision information. This work addresses these
challenges by leveraging the Fourier domain. We highlight that the Fourier
coefficients of spatially correlated noise exhibit sparsity and independence,
making them easier to handle. Additionally, Fourier coefficients contain global
information, enabling more significant supervision. Motivated by these
insights, we propose to establish noisy supervision in the Fourier domain. We
first prove that Fourier coefficients of a wide range of noise converge in
distribution to the Gaussian distribution. Exploiting this statistical
property, we establish the equivalence between using noisy targets and clean
targets in the Fourier domain. This leads to a unified learning framework
applicable to various image restoration tasks, diverse network architectures,
and different noise models. Extensive experiments validate the outstanding
performance of this framework in terms of both quantitative indices and
perceptual quality.

Abstract: Many people suffer from mental health problems but not everyone seeks
professional help or has access to mental health care. AI chatbots have
increasingly become a go-to for individuals who either have mental disorders or
simply want someone to talk to. This paper presents a study on participants who
have previously used chatbots and a scenario-based testing of large language
model (LLM) chatbots. Our findings indicate that AI chatbots were primarily
utilized as a "Five minute therapist" or as a non-judgmental companion.
Participants appreciated the anonymity and lack of judgment from chatbots.
However, there were concerns about privacy and the security of sensitive
information. The scenario-based testing of LLM chatbots highlighted additional
issues. Some chatbots were consistently reassuring, used emojis and names to
add a personal touch, and were quick to suggest seeking professional help.
However, there were limitations such as inconsistent tone, occasional
inappropriate responses (e.g., casual or romantic), and a lack of crisis
sensitivity, particularly in recognizing red flag language and escalating
responses appropriately. These findings can inform both the technology and
mental health care industries on how to better utilize AI chatbots to support
individuals during challenging emotional periods.

Abstract: Transforming relational databases into knowledge graphs with enriched
ontologies enhances semantic interoperability and unlocks advanced graph-based
learning and reasoning over data. However, previous approaches either demand
significant manual effort to derive an ontology from a database schema or
produce only a basic ontology. We present RIGOR, Retrieval-augmented Iterative
Generation of RDB Ontologies, an LLM-driven approach that turns relational
schemas into rich OWL ontologies with minimal human effort. RIGOR combines
three sources via RAG, the database schema and its documentation, a repository
of domain ontologies, and a growing core ontology, to prompt a generative LLM
for producing successive, provenance-tagged delta ontology fragments. Each
fragment is refined by a judge-LLM before being merged into the core ontology,
and the process iterates table-by-table following foreign key constraints until
coverage is complete. Applied to real-world databases, our approach outputs
ontologies that score highly on standard quality dimensions such as accuracy,
completeness, conciseness, adaptability, clarity, and consistency, while
substantially reducing manual effort.

achieves significant speedups while maintaining both statistical and
instantaneous flow fidelity. Our approach offers a modular, zero-shot
alternative to retraining-intensive strategies, supporting fast and reliable
urban flow monitoring under extreme sparsity. Diff-SPORT paves the way for
integrating generative modeling and explainability in sustainable urban

### [537] [$\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$: Benchmarking the Robustness of Audio-Visual Recognition Models at Test-Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00358)
*Sarthak Kumar Maharana,Saksham Singh Kushwaha,Baoming Zhang,Adrian Rodriguez,Songtao Wei,Yapeng Tian,Yunhui Guo*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为AVROBUSTBENCH的基准测试，用于评估音频-视觉模型在测试时的鲁棒性，并发现现有模型在双模态数据损坏下表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中音频和视觉模态可能同时发生变化，而现有基准测试仅关注单模态，无法全面评估音频-视觉模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 设计了包含四种数据集（AUDIOSET-2C、VGGSOUND-2C、KINETICS-2C和EPICKITCHENS-2C）的AVROBUSTBENCH，每种数据集包含75种双模态损坏。

Result: 现有音频-视觉模型在损坏严重性增加时鲁棒性下降，且在线测试时适应方法（TTA）改进有限。提出的AV2C方法在VGGSOUND-2C上表现更好。

Conclusion: AVROBUSTBENCH有助于推动更有效的音频-视觉TTA方法的发展。

Abstract: While recent audio-visual models have demonstrated impressive performance,
their robustness to distributional shifts at test-time remains not fully
understood. Existing robustness benchmarks mainly focus on single modalities,
making them insufficient for thoroughly assessing the robustness of
audio-visual models. Motivated by real-world scenarios where shifts can occur
$\textit{simultaneously}$ in both audio and visual modalities, we introduce
$\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
test-time robustness of audio-visual recognition models.
$\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$ comprises four audio-visual benchmark datasets,
$\texttt{AUDIOSET-2C}$, $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$, $\texttt{KINETICS-2C}$, and
$\texttt{EPICKITCHENS-2C}$, each incorporating 75 bimodal audio-visual
corruptions that are $\textit{co-occurring}$ and $\textit{correlated}$. Through
extensive evaluations, we observe that state-of-the-art supervised and
self-supervised audio-visual models exhibit declining robustness as corruption
severity increases. Furthermore, online test-time adaptation (TTA) methods, on
$\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$ and $\texttt{KINETICS-2C}$, offer minimal improvements
in performance under bimodal corruptions. We further propose $\texttt{AV2C}$, a
simple TTA approach enabling on-the-fly cross-modal fusion by penalizing
high-entropy samples, which achieves improvements on $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$. We
hope that $\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$ will steer the development of more effective
and robust audio-visual TTA approaches. Our code is available

*Yakun Song,Jiawei Chen,Xiaobin Zhuang,Chenpeng Du,Ziyang Ma,Jian Wu,Jian Cong,Dongya Jia,Zhuo Chen,Yuping Wang,Yuxuan Wang,Xie Chen*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: MagiCodec是一种新型的单层流式Transformer音频编解码器，通过多阶段训练管道（包括高斯噪声注入和潜在正则化）提升语义表达力，同时保持高重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频编解码器主要优化重建质量，但牺牲了下游任务中编码令牌的模型性能，MagiCodec旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用多阶段训练管道，结合高斯噪声注入和潜在正则化，分析噪声注入在频域的效果。

Result: MagiCodec在重建质量和下游任务中均优于现有编解码器，生成的令牌呈现Zipf-like分布，与自然语言类似。

Conclusion: MagiCodec在提升语义表达和重建质量方面表现优异，适用于基于语言模型的生成架构。

Abstract: Neural audio codecs have made significant strides in efficiently mapping raw
audio waveforms into discrete token representations, which are foundational for
contemporary audio generative models. However, most existing codecs are
optimized primarily for reconstruction quality, often at the expense of the
downstream modelability of the encoded tokens. Motivated by the need to
overcome this bottleneck, we introduce $\textbf{MagiCodec}$, a novel
single-layer, streaming Transformer-based audio codec. MagiCodec is designed
with a multistage training pipeline that incorporates Gaussian noise injection
and latent regularization, explicitly targeting the enhancement of semantic
expressiveness in the generated codes while preserving high reconstruction
fidelity. We analytically derive the effect of noise injection in the frequency
domain, demonstrating its efficacy in attenuating high-frequency components and
fostering robust tokenization. Extensive experimental evaluations show that
MagiCodec surpasses state-of-the-art codecs in both reconstruction quality and
downstream tasks. Notably, the tokens produced by MagiCodec exhibit Zipf-like
distributions, as observed in natural languages, thereby improving
compatibility with language-model-based generative architectures. The code and
pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/Ereboas/MagiCodec.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文介绍了XMAD-Bench，一个跨域多语言音频深度伪造基准测试，揭示了现有检测器在跨域场景中的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频深度伪造技术泛滥导致公众易受诈骗和虚假信息侵害，现有检测器在跨域场景中表现不佳。

Method: 构建XMAD-Bench数据集，包含668.8小时的真实和伪造语音，训练和测试集在说话者、生成方法和音频源上完全独立。

Result: 实验显示检测器在域内性能接近100%，但在跨域场景中性能可能接近随机猜测。

Conclusion: 需开发更鲁棒的音频深度伪造检测器，以应对不同语言、说话者和生成方法的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio generation led to an increasing number of deepfakes,
making the general public more vulnerable to financial scams, identity theft,
and misinformation. Audio deepfake detectors promise to alleviate this issue,
with many recent studies reporting accuracy rates close to 99%. However, these
methods are typically tested in an in-domain setup, where the deepfake samples
from the training and test sets are produced by the same generative models. To
this end, we introduce XMAD-Bench, a large-scale cross-domain multilingual
audio deepfake benchmark comprising 668.8 hours of real and deepfake speech. In
our novel dataset, the speakers, the generative methods, and the real audio
sources are distinct across training and test splits. This leads to a
challenging cross-domain evaluation setup, where audio deepfake detectors can
be tested ``in the wild''. Our in-domain and cross-domain experiments indicate
a clear disparity between the in-domain performance of deepfake detectors,
which is usually as high as 100%, and the cross-domain performance of the same
models, which is sometimes similar to random chance. Our benchmark highlights
the need for the development of robust audio deepfake detectors, which maintain
their generalization capacity across different languages, speakers, generative
methods, and data sources. Our benchmark is publicly released at
https://github.com/ristea/xmad-bench/.

### [540] [Learning Sparsity for Effective and Efficient Music Performance Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01319)
*Xingjian Diao,Tianzhen Yang,Chunhui Zhang,Weiyi Wu,Ming Cheng,Jiang Gui*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Sparsify的稀疏学习框架，用于解决音乐表演音频-视觉问答（Music AVQA）中的效率问题，通过三种稀疏化策略实现了性能提升和训练时间减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音乐表演的密集连续音频和音频-视觉无缝整合为多模态场景理解和推理带来挑战，现有方法存在信息冗余和效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出Sparsify框架，集成三种稀疏化策略，并设计关键子集选择算法以提高数据效率。

Result: 在Music AVQA数据集上达到最优性能，训练时间减少28.32%，同时使用25%的训练数据可保留70-80%的性能。

Conclusion: Sparsify框架有效提升了Music AVQA任务的效率和性能，为多模态学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Music performances, characterized by dense and continuous audio as well as
seamless audio-visual integration, present unique challenges for multimodal
scene understanding and reasoning. Recent Music Performance Audio-Visual
Question Answering (Music AVQA) datasets have been proposed to reflect these
challenges, highlighting the continued need for more effective integration of
audio-visual representations in complex question answering. However, existing
Music AVQA methods often rely on dense and unoptimized representations, leading
to inefficiencies in the isolation of key information, the reduction of
redundancy, and the prioritization of critical samples. To address these
challenges, we introduce Sparsify, a sparse learning framework specifically
designed for Music AVQA. It integrates three sparsification strategies into an
end-to-end pipeline and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Music AVQA
datasets. In addition, it reduces training time by 28.32% compared to its fully
trained dense counterpart while maintaining accuracy, demonstrating clear
efficiency gains. To further improve data efficiency, we propose a key-subset
selection algorithm that selects and uses approximately 25% of MUSIC-AVQA v2.0
training data and retains 70-80% of full-data performance across models.

*Arjun Prasaath Anbazhagan,Parteek Kumar,Ujjwal Kaur,Aslihan Akalin,Kevin Zhu,Sean O'Brien*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）如何通过文本表示学习音频世界，并通过生成代码间接生成音频。实验表明，LLMs能生成基础音频，但随着复杂度增加，性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在文本训练基础上生成音频的能力，填补文本与音频之间的鸿沟。

Method: 采用三阶段方法（音符、环境音、人声），通过生成代码间接生成音频，并用FAD和CLAP评分评估质量。

Result: LLMs能生成基础音频，但复杂度增加时性能下降。

Conclusion: LLMs对音频世界有潜在理解，但生成能力有限，需进一步研究提升其音频生成质量。

Abstract: How does textual representation of audio relate to the Large Language Model's
(LLMs) learning about the audio world? This research investigates the extent to
which LLMs can be prompted to generate audio, despite their primary training in
textual data. We employ a three-tier approach, progressively increasing the
complexity of audio generation: 1) Musical Notes, 2) Environmental Sounds, and
3) Human Speech. To bridge the gap between text and audio, we leverage code as
an intermediary, prompting LLMs to generate code that, when executed, produces
the desired audio output. To evaluate the quality and accuracy of the generated
audio, we employ FAD and CLAP scores. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can
generate basic audio features, their performance deteriorates as the complexity
of the audio increases. This suggests that while LLMs possess a latent
understanding of the auditory world, their ability to translate this
understanding into tangible audio output remains rudimentary. Further research
into techniques that can enhance the quality and diversity of LLM-generated
audio can lead to an improvement in the performance of text-based LLMs in
generating audio.

### [542] [Counterfactual Activation Editing for Post-hoc Prosody and Mispronunciation Correction in TTS Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00832)
*Kyowoon Lee,Artyom Stitsyuk,Gunu Jho,Inchul Hwang,Jaesik Choi*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重新训练即可调整TTS模型的方法，通过编辑内部表示实现韵律控制和发音纠正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有韵律控制和发音纠正方法依赖额外模块或训练，限制了灵活性，尤其在低资源场景下。

Method: 采用反事实激活编辑技术，直接操作预训练TTS模型的内部表示。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效调整韵律特征并纠正发音，同时保持合成质量。

Conclusion: 该方法为无需重新训练的TTS输出优化提供了新途径，填补了预训练模型与可编辑语音合成之间的空白。

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) have significantly improved speech
naturalness, increasing the demand for precise prosody control and
mispronunciation correction. Existing approaches for prosody manipulation often
depend on specialized modules or additional training, limiting their capacity
for post-hoc adjustments. Similarly, traditional mispronunciation correction
relies on grapheme-to-phoneme dictionaries, making it less practical in
low-resource settings. We introduce Counterfactual Activation Editing, a
model-agnostic method that manipulates internal representations in a
pre-trained TTS model to achieve post-hoc control of prosody and pronunciation.
Experimental results show that our method effectively adjusts prosodic features
and corrects mispronunciations while preserving synthesis quality. This opens
the door to inference-time refinement of TTS outputs without retraining,
bridging the gap between pre-trained TTS models and editable speech synthesis.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: CoVoMix2是一种非自回归框架，用于零样本多说话人对话生成，通过流匹配生成模型直接预测梅尔频谱，支持可控对话生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统在多说话人对话生成中难以保持说话人一致性、模拟重叠语音并高效合成连贯对话。

Method: CoVoMix2采用流匹配生成模型直接从多流转录预测梅尔频谱，提出转录级说话人解耦、句子级对齐和提示级随机掩码策略。

Result: CoVoMix2在语音质量、说话人一致性和推理速度上优于MoonCast和Sesame等基线模型，支持重叠语音和精确时序控制。

Conclusion: CoVoMix2在真实语音生成场景中表现出强泛化能力，无需提示转录即可运行。

Abstract: Generating natural-sounding, multi-speaker dialogue is crucial for
applications such as podcast creation, virtual agents, and multimedia content
generation. However, existing systems struggle to maintain speaker consistency,
model overlapping speech, and synthesize coherent conversations efficiently. In
this paper, we introduce CoVoMix2, a fully non-autoregressive framework for
zero-shot multi-talker dialogue generation. CoVoMix2 directly predicts
mel-spectrograms from multi-stream transcriptions using a flow-matching-based
generative model, eliminating the reliance on intermediate token
representations. To better capture realistic conversational dynamics, we
propose transcription-level speaker disentanglement, sentence-level alignment,
and prompt-level random masking strategies. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines like MoonCast and
Sesame in speech quality, speaker consistency, and inference speed. Notably,
CoVoMix2 operates without requiring transcriptions for the prompt and supports
controllable dialogue generation, including overlapping speech and precise
timing control, demonstrating strong generalizability to real-world speech
generation scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种文本引导的音频空间化（TAS）框架，通过灵活文本提示生成高质量双耳音频，并构建了大规模数据集SpatialTAS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频空间化方法在多对象交互环境中缺乏灵活控制，需改进。

Method: 提出TAS框架，利用文本提示和翻转声道音频训练模型，构建SpatialTAS数据集。

Result: 模型在模拟和真实数据集上表现优异，生成的双耳音频具有高质量和空间语义一致性。

Conclusion: 文本提示为双耳音频生成提供了灵活交互控制，TAS框架在质量和语义一致性上优于现有方法。

Abstract: To enhance immersive experiences, binaural audio offers spatial awareness of
sounding objects in AR, VR, and embodied AI applications. While existing audio
spatialization methods can generally map any available monaural audio to
binaural audio signals, they often lack the flexible and interactive control
needed in complex multi-object user-interactive environments. To address this,
we propose a Text-guided Audio Spatialization (TAS) framework that utilizes
flexible text prompts and evaluates our model from unified generation and
comprehension perspectives. Due to the limited availability of premium and
large-scale stereo data, we construct the SpatialTAS dataset, which encompasses
376,000 simulated binaural audio samples to facilitate the training of our
model. Our model learns binaural differences guided by 3D spatial location and
relative position prompts, augmented by flipped-channel audio. It outperforms
existing methods on both simulated and real-recorded datasets, demonstrating
superior generalization and accuracy. Besides, we develop an assessment model
based on Llama-3.1-8B, which evaluates the spatial semantic coherence between
our generated binaural audio and text prompts through a spatial reasoning task.
Results demonstrate that text prompts provide flexible and interactive control
to generate binaural audio with excellent quality and semantic consistency in
spatial locations. Dataset is available at

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自监督训练方法GRAM，用于提升音频基础模型在真实世界场景中的表现，特别是在空间音频表示学习方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频基础模型在干燥、非空间、单源音频上表现良好，但在真实场景中表现受限，缺乏空间感知能力。

Method: 提出GRAM方法，采用自监督训练，适用于任何基于掩码的深度学习模型，并测试了两种骨干网络（Transformer和Mamba）。

Result: GRAM在自然声音场景和空间音频任务中表现优异，缩小了与干燥音频的性能差距，并在声音定位任务中超越现有模型。

Conclusion: GRAM显著提升了音频基础模型在真实场景中的鲁棒性和性能，尤其在空间音频表示学习方面。

Abstract: While audio foundation models perform well on myriad of tasks from sound
classification to speech analysis, these models are trained and tested on dry,
non-spatial, single-source audio clips. This limits their success in real-world
situations and results in spatially unaware audio embeddings. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel self-supervised training approach for
General-Purpose, Real-world Audio Models (GRAMs). The GRAM training approach
enables robust spatial audio representation learning for naturalistic, noisy
sound scenes and can be applied to any masking-based deep learning model. We
demonstrate the success of our approach by training two state-of-the-art
models, one with a transformer and one with a mamba backbone. We assess the
quality of the extracted audio representations from GRAMs using the original
version of the HEAR benchmark, a newly synthesized, naturalistic version of the
HEAR benchmark, and novel sound localization tasks based on HEAR benchmark
datasets. The results show that our approach minimizes the performance gap
between dry, non-spatial, single-source sound scenes and naturalistic sound
scenes for crucial tasks such as auditory scene analysis, outperforming
existing state-of-the-art audio foundation models at a fraction of the training
steps. Moreover, GRAMs show state-of-the-art performance on sound localization
tasks, exceeding even supervised sound localization models. In sum, the
proposed approach represents a significant advancement towards robust audio
foundation models for real-world applications with state-of-the-art performance
on naturalistic sound scenes as well as spatial audio representation learning.

Motivation: 探讨MFCC和预训练模型特征在VAD中的互补性，并验证简单融合策略的有效性。

Method: 提出FusionVAD框架，采用拼接、加法和交叉注意力三种融合策略。

Result: 加法融合表现最佳，融合模型显著优于单特征模型，并在多个数据集上超越Pyannote，平均提升2.04%。

Conclusion: 简单特征融合能增强VAD的鲁棒性，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Voice Activity Detection (VAD) plays a key role in speech processing, often
utilizing hand-crafted or neural features. This study examines the
effectiveness of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and pre-trained
model (PTM) features, including wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, UniSpeech, MMS, and
Whisper. We propose FusionVAD, a unified framework that combines both feature
types using three fusion strategies: concatenation, addition, and
cross-attention (CA). Experimental results reveal that simple fusion
techniques, particularly addition, outperform CA in both accuracy and
efficiency. Fusion-based models consistently surpass single-feature models,
highlighting the complementary nature of MFCCs and PTM features. Notably, our
best-performing fusion model exceeds the state-of-the-art Pyannote across
multiple datasets, achieving an absolute average improvement of 2.04%. These
results confirm that simple feature fusion enhances VAD robustness while
maintaining computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 充分利用目标时频点及其周围信息以提高语音增强效果，同时降低计算复杂度。

Method: 结合子带模块和深度过滤模块，分两阶段解耦时间与频率分量，并引入TAConv模块增强卷积特征提取。

Result: 实验表明HDF-Net能有效利用周围时频点信息，性能优于其他先进系统且资源消耗更少。

Conclusion: HDF-Net通过层次化深度过滤和子带处理，显著提升了语音增强效果和效率。

Abstract: This paper proposes a model that integrates sub-band processing and deep
filtering to fully exploit information from the target time-frequency (TF) bin
and its surrounding TF bins for single-channel speech enhancement. The sub-band
module captures surrounding frequency bin information at the input, while the
deep filtering module applies filtering at the output to both the target TF bin
and its surrounding TF bins. To further improve the model performance, we
decouple deep filtering into temporal and frequency components and introduce a
two-stage framework, reducing the complexity of filter coefficient prediction
at each stage. Additionally, we propose the TAConv module to strengthen
convolutional feature extraction. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed hierarchical deep filtering network (HDF-Net) effectively utilizes
surrounding TF bin information and outperforms other advanced systems while
using fewer resources.

Result: 提出了FusionAudio数据集（120万描述和600万QA对），并开发了改进的音频模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂音频环境的自动化理解提供了更细致和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality, large-scale audio captioning is crucial for advancing audio
understanding, yet current automated methods often generate captions that lack
fine-grained detail and contextual accuracy, primarily due to their reliance on
limited unimodal or superficial multimodal information. Drawing inspiration
from human auditory perception, which adeptly integrates cross-modal cues and
performs sophisticated auditory scene analysis, we introduce a novel two-stage
automated pipeline. This pipeline first employs specialized pretrained models
to extract diverse contextual cues (e.g., speech, music, general sounds, and
visual information from associated video). A large language model (LLM) then
synthesizes these rich, multimodal inputs to generate detailed and
context-aware audio captions. Key contributions of this work include: (1) the
proposed scalable method for fine-grained audio caption generation; (2)
FusionAudio, a new large-scale dataset comprising 1.2 million such detailed
captions, combined with 6 million QA pairs; and (3) enhanced audio models
developed using FusionAudio, specifically a CLAP-based audio encoder with
superior audio-text alignment and instruction following. This paper paves the
way for more nuanced and accurate automated understanding of complex audio
environments. Code and data can be found in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNN推理的计算复杂度高，尤其在资源受限的边缘设备上，稀疏性利用是解决这一挑战的有效方法。

Method: 提出FlexiSAGA加速器，支持七种数据流，并结合专为其设计的DNN剪枝方法。

Result: 实验显示，FlexiSAGA在稀疏推理速度上比商业和文献报道的加速器快1.41至4.28倍。

Conclusion: FlexiSAGA通过硬件和DNN协同设计，显著提升了稀疏和密集DNN算子的处理效率。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs),
have become an important tool for a wide range of applications, from computer
vision to natural language processing. However, the computational complexity of
DNN inference poses a significant challenge, particularly for processing on
resource-constrained edge devices. One promising approach to address this
challenge is the exploitation of sparsity in DNN operator weights.
  In this work, we present FlexiSAGA, an architecturally configurable and
dataflow-flexible AI hardware accelerator for the sparse and dense processing
of general matrix multiplications (GEMMs). FlexiSAGA supports seven different
sparse and dense dataflows, enabling efficient processing of resource intensive
DNN operators. Additionally, we propose a DNN pruning method specifically
tailored towards the FlexiSAGA architecture, allowing for near-optimal
processing of dense and sparse convolution and fully-connected operators,
facilitating a DNN/HW co-design flow. Our results show a whole DNN
sparse-over-dense inference speedup ranging from 1.41 up to 4.28, outperforming
commercial and literature-reported accelerator platforms.

*Mohammadhossein Homaei,Mehran Tarif,Agustin Di Bartolo,Oscar Mogollon Gutierrez,Mar Avila*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的路由协议RL-RPL-UA，用于改善水下物联网（IoUT）中的网络性能，相比传统方法显著提升了数据包传输效率、降低了能耗并延长了网络寿命。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下物联网面临带宽低、延迟高、移动性强和能源有限等挑战，传统路由协议（如RPL）在此环境下表现不佳，因此需要一种更高效的路由解决方案。

Method: RL-RPL-UA协议在每个节点中嵌入轻量级强化学习代理，根据本地信息（如数据包投递率、缓冲区水平、链路质量和剩余能量）动态选择最佳父节点，同时保持与标准RPL消息的兼容性。

Result: 仿真实验显示，RL-RPL-UA将数据包投递率提高9.2%，每数据包能耗降低14.8%，网络寿命延长80秒。

Conclusion: RL-RPL-UA是一种高效且节能的水下网络路由解决方案，具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) faces major challenges such as low
bandwidth, high latency, mobility, and limited energy resources. Traditional
routing protocols like RPL, which were designed for land-based networks, do not
perform well in these underwater conditions. This paper introduces RL-RPL-UA, a
new routing protocol that uses reinforcement learning to improve performance in
underwater environments. Each node includes a lightweight RL agent that selects
the best parent node based on local information such as packet delivery ratio,
buffer level, link quality, and remaining energy. RL-RPL-UA keeps full
compatibility with standard RPL messages and adds a dynamic objective function
to support real-time decision-making. Simulations using Aqua-Sim show that
RL-RPL-UA increases packet delivery by up to 9.2%, reduces energy use per
packet by 14.8%, and extends network lifetime by 80 seconds compared to
traditional methods. These results suggest that RL-RPL-UA is a promising and
energy-efficient routing solution for underwater networks.

Abstract: This paper introduces a dual-layer framework for network operator-side
quality of experience (QoE) assessment that integrates both objective network
modeling and subjective user perception extracted from live-streaming
platforms. On the objective side, we develop a machine learning model trained
on mean opinion scores (MOS) computed via the ITU-T P.1203 reference
implementation, allowing accurate prediction of user-perceived video quality
using only network parameters such as packet loss, delay, jitter, and
throughput without reliance on video content or client-side instrumentation. On
the subjective side, we present a semantic filtering and scoring pipeline that
processes user comments from live streams to extract performance-related
feedback. A large language model is used to assign scalar MOS scores to
filtered comments in a deterministic and reproducible manner. To support
scalable and interpretable analysis, we con- struct a labeled dataset of 47,894
live-stream comments, of which about 34,000 are identified as QoE-relevant
through multi-layer semantic filtering. Each comment is enriched with simulated
Internet Service Provider attribution and temporally aligned using synthetic
timestamps in 5-min intervals. The resulting dataset enables operator-level
aggregation and time-series analysis of user-perceived quality. A delta MOS
metric is proposed to measure each Internet service provider's deviation from
platform-wide sentiment, allowing detection of localized degradations even in
the absence of direct network telemetry. A controlled outage simulation
confirms the framework's effectiveness in identifying service disruptions
through comment-based trends alone. The system provides each operator with its
own subjective MOS and the global platform average per interval, enabling
real-time interpretation of performance deviations and comparison with
objective network-based QoE estimates.

Abstract: Psoriasis is a long-term inflammatory skin disease that remains difficult to
treat. In this study, we developed a new topical treatment by combining metal
oxide nanoparticles: cerium oxide (CeO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), and silver (Ag),
with natural plant extracts in a gel made from fish collagen and agar. The
nanoparticles were characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, dynamic light
scattering (DLS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), showing good stability and a uniform particle size
distribution (ZnO averaged 66 nm).
  To enhance therapeutic potential, the gel was enriched with plant-derived
antioxidants from bitter melon, ginger, and neem. This formulation was tested
on an animal model of psoriasis. The treated group exhibited faster wound
healing and reduced inflammation compared to both placebo and untreated groups,
with statistically significant results (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001) observed from
Day 3, becoming more pronounced by Day 14.
  These results indicate that the combination of nanoparticles with plant-based
components in a topical gel may provide a promising new approach to psoriasis
treatment. Further studies are recommended to evaluate long-term safety and
therapeutic effectiveness.

Abstract: Coordinated human movement depends on the integration of multisensory inputs,
sensorimotor transformation, and motor execution, as well as sensory feedback
resulting from body-environment interaction. Building dynamic models of the
sensory-musculoskeletal system is essential for understanding movement control
and investigating human behaviours. Here, we report a human
sensory-musculoskeletal model, termed SMS-Human, that integrates precise
anatomical representations of bones, joints, and muscle-tendon units with
multimodal sensory inputs involving visual, vestibular, proprioceptive, and
tactile components. A stage-wise hierarchical deep reinforcement learning
framework was developed to address the inherent challenges of high-dimensional
control in musculoskeletal systems with integrated multisensory information.
Using this framework, we demonstrated the simulation of three representative
movement tasks, including bipedal locomotion, vision-guided object
manipulation, and human-machine interaction during bicycling. Our results
showed a close resemblance between natural and simulated human motor
behaviours. The simulation also revealed musculoskeletal dynamics that could
not be directly measured. This work sheds deeper insights into the sensorimotor
dynamics of human movements, facilitates quantitative understanding of human
behaviours in interactive contexts, and informs the design of systems with
embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Autonomy is a hallmark of animal intelligence, enabling adaptive and
intelligent behavior in complex environments without relying on external reward
or task structure. Existing reinforcement learning approaches to exploration in
sparse reward and reward-free environments, including class of methods known as
intrinsic motivation, exhibit inconsistent exploration patterns and thus fail
to produce robust autonomous behaviors observed in animals. Moreover, systems
neuroscience has largely overlooked the neural basis of autonomy, focusing
instead on experimental paradigms where animals are motivated by external
reward rather than engaging in unconstrained, naturalistic and task-independent
behavior. To bridge these gaps, we introduce a novel model-based intrinsic
drive explicitly designed to capture robust autonomous exploration observed in
animals. Our method (3M-Progress) motivates naturalistic behavior by tracking
divergence between the agent's current world model and an ethological prior. We
demonstrate that artificial embodied agents trained with 3M-Progress capture
the explainable variance in behavioral patterns and whole-brain neural-glial
dynamics recorded from autonomously-behaving larval zebrafish, introducing the
first goal-driven, population-level model of neural-glial computation. Our
findings establish a computational framework connecting model-based intrinsic
motivation to naturalistic behavior, providing a foundation for building
artificial agents with animal-like autonomy.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a significant increase in the adoption of AI
techniques to enhance electronic design automation. In particular, the
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked significant interest in
LLM-assisted hardware design generation, spanning applications from classical
digital circuits to quantum computing. Despite substantial progress in this
direction, the quality of LLM-generated hardware design still cannot meet the
requirements for practical deployment. In this work, we identify three critical
challenges hindering the development of LLM-assisted hardware design
generation: 1) limited data availability, 2) varied data quality, 3) inadequate
inference-time efficiency. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper
introduces a two-stage framework for AI-assisted hardware design by exploring
decentralized training and personalized inference. In the first stage, we
propose to harness private domain design sources through a hierarchical
decentralized training mechanism that addresses data-sharing constraints. To
mitigate the impact of low-quality data, we identify optimization opportunities
in hardware generation tasks, using user-defined metrics for model aggregation.
The second stage focuses on client personalization to enhance both speed and
quality. We introduce a new metric, Trueput, to analyze LLM-assisted hardware
generation efficiency. To optimize Trueput, we implement personalized
inference-time acceleration and customized sampling strategies. Evaluating both
classical and quantum benchmarks, our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed two-stage framework can significantly improve the model capability for
hardware design generation. As orthogonal enhancements to existing methods, our
framework can achieve $33\% \sim 50\%$ semantic accuracy improvement and $2.3$
times speedup, depending on the difficulty of the generation tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 量化低层失真和噪声对神经网络任务精度的影响，并开发数学模型以快速预测模拟矩阵向量乘法（MVM）的输出。

Method: 开发了包含瞬时电流IR-drop和ADC量化效应的数学模型，并基于PyTorch框架评估BERT和ALBERT网络的精度影响。

Result: 硬件感知微调对ADC量化和PCM读噪声有效，但对IR-drop效果有限，需更复杂的训练方法。

Conclusion: 未来需结合更复杂的训练方法（如Tile-circuit模型）以提高AIMC硬件上大型神经网络的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Analog In-Memory Compute (AIMC) can improve the energy efficiency of Deep
Learning by orders of magnitude. Yet analog-domain device and circuit
non-idealities -- within the analog ``Tiles'' performing Matrix-Vector Multiply
(MVM) operations -- can degrade neural-network task accuracy. We quantify the
impact of low-level distortions and noise, and develop a mathematical model for
Multiply-ACcumulate (MAC) operations mapped to analog tiles.
Instantaneous-current IR-drop (the most significant circuit non-ideality), and
ADC quantization effects are fully captured by this model, which can predict
MVM tile-outputs both rapidly and accurately, as compared to much slower
rigorous circuit simulations. A statistical model of PCM read noise at
nanosecond timescales is derived from -- and matched against -- experimental
measurements. We integrate these (statistical) device and (deterministic)
circuit effects into a PyTorch-based framework to assess the accuracy impact on
the BERT and ALBERT Transformer networks. We show that hardware-aware
fine-tuning using simple Gaussian noise provides resilience against ADC
quantization and PCM read noise effects, but is less effective against IR-drop.
This is because IR-drop -- although deterministic -- is non-linear, is changing
significantly during the time-integration window, and is ultimately dependent
on all the excitations being introduced in parallel into the analog tile. The
apparent inability of simple Gaussian noise applied during training to properly
prepare a DNN network for IR-drop during inference implies that more complex
training approaches -- incorporating advances such as the Tile-circuit model
introduced here -- will be critical for resilient deployment of large neural
networks onto AIMC hardware.

Abstract: Leveraging high degrees of unstructured sparsity is a promising approach to

important for emerging Edge-AI applications. We introduce VUSA, a
systolic-array architecture that virtually grows based on the present sparsity
to perform larger matrix multiplications with the same number of physical
multiply-accumulate MAC units. The proposed architecture achieves saving by 37%

peak-performance, compared to a baseline systolic array architecture in a
commercial 16-nm technology. Still, the proposed architecture supports
acceleration for any DNN with any sparsity - even no sparsity at all. Thus, the
proposed architecture is application-independent, making it viable for
general-purpose AI acceleration.

Abstract: Selection bias, arising from the systematic inclusion or exclusion of certain
samples, poses a significant challenge to the validity of causal inference.
While Bareinboim et al. introduced methods for recovering unbiased
observational and interventional distributions from biased data using partial
external information, the complexity of the backdoor adjustment and the
method's strong reliance on observational data limit its applicability in many
practical settings. In this paper, we formally discover the recoverability of
$P(Y^*_{x^*})$ under selection bias with experimental data. By explicitly
constructing counterfactual worlds via Structural Causal Models (SCMs), we
analyze how selection mechanisms in the observational world propagate to the
counterfactual domain. We derive a complete set of graphical and theoretical
criteria to determine that the experimental distribution remain unaffected by
selection bias. Furthermore, we propose principled methods for leveraging
partially unbiased observational data to recover $P(Y^*_{x^*})$ from biased
experimental datasets. Simulation studies replicating realistic research
scenarios demonstrate the practical utility of our approach, offering concrete
guidance for mitigating selection bias in applied causal inference.

Abstract: Multi-agent large language models (MA-LLMs) are a rapidly growing research
area that leverages multiple interacting language agents to tackle complex

synthesizes the latest research on agent profiles, communication structures,

to address the lack of direct comparisons in the field, illustrating how
factors like scalability, communication structure, and decision-making
processes influence MA-LLM performance. By examining frequent practices and

Conclusion: 提倡科学严谨性，避免术语混淆，将已有研究成果融入LLM代理的新发展中。

Abstract: The terms Agentic AI and Multiagentic AI have recently gained popularity in
discussions on generative artificial intelligence, often used to describe
autonomous software agents and systems composed of such agents. However, the
use of these terms confuses these buzzwords with well-established concepts in
AI literature: intelligent agents and multi-agent systems. This article offers
a critical analysis of this conceptual misuse. We review the theoretical
origins of "agentic" in the social sciences (Bandura, 1986) and philosophical
notions of intentionality (Dennett, 1971), and then summarise foundational
works on intelligent agents and multi-agent systems by Wooldridge, Jennings and
others. We examine classic agent architectures, from simple reactive agents to
Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) models, and highlight key properties (autonomy,
reactivity, proactivity, social capability) that define agency in AI. We then
discuss recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and agent platforms
based on LLMs, including the emergence of LLM-powered AI agents and open-source
multi-agent orchestration frameworks. We argue that the term AI Agentic is
often used as a buzzword for what are essentially AI agents, and AI
Multiagentic for what are multi-agent systems. This confusion overlooks decades
of research in the field of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. The
article advocates for scientific and technological rigour and the use of
established terminology from the state of the art in AI, incorporating the
wealth of existing knowledge, including standards for multi-agent system
platforms, communication languages and coordination and cooperation algorithms,
agreement technologies (automated negotiation, argumentation, virtual
organisations, trust, reputation, etc.), into the new and promising wave of
LLM-based AI agents, so as not to end up reinventing the wheel.

Result: AI年龄验证系统存在技术局限性和硬件问题，难以避免偏见，成本效益不如政府ID验证。

Conclusion: 短期内部署AI年龄验证系统是不明智的。

Abstract: In the near future a governmental body will be asked to allow companies to
use AI for age verification. If they allow it the resulting system will both be
easily circumvented and disproportionately misclassify minorities and low
socioeconomic status users. This is predictable by showing that other very
similar systems (facial recognition and remote proctoring software) have
similar issues despite years of efforts to mitigate their biases. These biases
are due to technical limitations both of the AI models themselves and the
physical hardware they are running on that will be difficult to overcome below
the cost of government ID-based age verification. Thus in, the near future,
deploying an AI system for age verification is folly.

others. The risk assessment covers both technical risks which affect product

locally-deployed, open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract
diagnostic information from free-text cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)
reports. Materials and Methods: We evaluated nine open-source LLMs on their
ability to identify diagnoses and classify patients into various cardiac
diagnostic categories based on descriptive findings in 109 clinical CMR
reports. Performance was quantified using standard classification metrics
including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We also employed confusion
matrices to examine patterns of misclassification across models. Results: Most
open-source LLMs demonstrated exceptional performance in classifying reports
into different diagnostic categories. Google's Gemma2 model achieved the
highest average F1 score of 0.98, followed by Qwen2.5:32B and DeepseekR1-32B
with F1 scores of 0.96 and 0.95, respectively. All other evaluated models
attained average scores above 0.93, with Mistral and DeepseekR1-7B being the
only exceptions. The top four LLMs outperformed our board-certified
cardiologist (F1 score of 0.94) across all evaluation metrics in analyzing CMR
reports. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of implementing
open-source, privacy-preserving LLMs in clinical settings for automated
analysis of imaging reports, enabling accurate, fast and resource-efficient
diagnostic categorization.

TL;DR: 研究了提示工程技术对大型语言模型（LLMs）在医学领域中准确性和置信度的影响，发现Chain-of-Thought提示提高准确性但导致过度自信，情感提示进一步增加置信度风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨提示工程技术如何影响LLMs在医学任务中的表现，特别是在准确性和置信度校准方面的作用。

Method: 使用波斯医学考试数据集，评估五种LLMs在不同配置（温度、提示风格、置信度标度）下的表现，采用AUC-ROC、Brier Score和ECE等指标。

Result: Chain-of-Thought提示提高准确性但导致过度自信，情感提示增加风险；小型模型表现较差，专有模型准确性高但置信度校准不足。

Conclusion: 提示工程技术需同时关注准确性和不确定性校准，以适用于高风险的医学任务。

Abstract: This paper investigates how prompt engineering techniques impact both
accuracy and confidence elicitation in Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to
medical contexts. Using a stratified dataset of Persian board exam questions
across multiple specialties, we evaluated five LLMs - GPT-4o, o3-mini,
Llama-3.3-70b, Llama-3.1-8b, and DeepSeek-v3 - across 156 configurations. These
configurations varied in temperature settings (0.3, 0.7, 1.0), prompt styles
(Chain-of-Thought, Few-Shot, Emotional, Expert Mimicry), and confidence scales
(1-10, 1-100). We used AUC-ROC, Brier Score, and Expected Calibration Error
(ECE) to evaluate alignment between confidence and actual performance.
Chain-of-Thought prompts improved accuracy but also led to overconfidence,
highlighting the need for calibration. Emotional prompting further inflated
confidence, risking poor decisions. Smaller models like Llama-3.1-8b
underperformed across all metrics, while proprietary models showed higher
accuracy but still lacked calibrated confidence. These results suggest prompt
engineering must address both accuracy and uncertainty to be effective in
high-stakes medical tasks.

TL;DR: 论文评估了六种开源LLM在物理学专家推荐任务中的表现，发现模型存在不一致性和偏见，mixtral-8x7b表现最稳定，而llama3.1-70b变异性最高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估LLM在学术推荐任务中的表现，尤其是其一致性、事实性和偏见问题。

Method: 使用美国物理学会和OpenAlex的真实数据作为基准，比较模型输出与实际学术记录。

Result: 结果显示所有模型均存在不一致性和偏见，mixtral-8x7b最稳定，llama3.1-70b变异性最高。模型普遍存在性别、种族和学术流行度偏见。

Conclusion: 结论指出需要改进LLM以提高推荐系统的可靠性和公平性。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of six open-weight LLMs (llama3-8b,
llama3.1-8b, gemma2-9b, mixtral-8x7b, llama3-70b, llama3.1-70b) in recommending
experts in physics across five tasks: top-k experts by field, influential
scientists by discipline, epoch, seniority, and scholar counterparts. The
evaluation examines consistency, factuality, and biases related to gender,
ethnicity, academic popularity, and scholar similarity. Using ground-truth data
from the American Physical Society and OpenAlex, we establish scholarly
benchmarks by comparing model outputs to real-world academic records. Our
analysis reveals inconsistencies and biases across all models. mixtral-8x7b
produces the most stable outputs, while llama3.1-70b shows the highest
variability. Many models exhibit duplication, and some, particularly gemma2-9b
and llama3.1-8b, struggle with formatting errors. LLMs generally recommend real
scientists, but accuracy drops in field-, epoch-, and seniority-specific
queries, consistently favoring senior scholars. Representation biases persist,
replicating gender imbalances (reflecting male predominance),
under-representing Asian scientists, and over-representing White scholars.
Despite some diversity in institutional and collaboration networks, models
favor highly cited and productive scholars, reinforcing the rich-getricher
effect while offering limited geographical representation. These findings
highlight the need to improve LLMs for more reliable and equitable scholarly
recommendations.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合自然语言处理（NLP）和传统收视数据的机器学习框架，用于提高电视节目收视率的预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电视网络在节目决策时面临高财务风险，通常依赖有限的历史数据预测收视率。

Method: 通过提取剧集对话的情感基调、认知复杂性和叙事结构等NLP特征，结合SARIMAX、滚动XGBoost和特征选择模型进行预测。

Result: NLP特征对某些剧集的预测有显著提升，同时提出了一种基于对话向量相似性的评分方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在不同类型节目中表现良好，为内容创作者和营销人员提供了数据驱动的见解。

Abstract: Television networks face high financial risk when making programming
decisions, often relying on limited historical data to forecast episodic
viewership. This study introduces a machine learning framework that integrates
natural language processing (NLP) features from over 25000 television episodes
with traditional viewership data to enhance predictive accuracy. By extracting
emotional tone, cognitive complexity, and narrative structure from episode
dialogue, we evaluate forecasting performance using SARIMAX, rolling XGBoost,
and feature selection models. While prior viewership remains a strong baseline
predictor, NLP features contribute meaningful improvements for some series. We
also introduce a similarity scoring method based on Euclidean distance between
aggregate dialogue vectors to compare shows by content. Tested across diverse
genres, including Better Call Saul and Abbott Elementary, our framework reveals
genre-specific performance and offers interpretable metrics for writers,
executives, and marketers seeking data-driven insight into audience behavior.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在高风险决策（如器官分配）中与人类道德价值观的一致性。

Method: 系统评估多个LLMs在肾脏分配场景中的行为，并与人类偏好对比。

Result: LLMs在属性优先级上与人类价值观偏差大，且决策确定性高。少量样本微调可改善结果。

Conclusion: 需明确LLMs在道德/伦理领域的对齐策略。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes
decision-making -- such as allocating scarce resources like donor organs --
raises critical questions about their alignment with human moral values. We
systematically evaluate the behavior of several prominent LLMs against human
preferences in kidney allocation scenarios and show that LLMs: i) exhibit stark
deviations from human values in prioritizing various attributes, and ii) in
contrast to humans, LLMs rarely express indecision, opting for deterministic
decisions even when alternative indecision mechanisms (e.g., coin flipping) are
provided. Nonetheless, we show that low-rank supervised fine-tuning with few
samples is often effective in improving both decision consistency and
calibrating indecision modeling. These findings illustrate the necessity of
explicit alignment strategies for LLMs in moral/ethical domains.

TL;DR: 本研究采用自下而上的方法，通过分析AI产品的用户评论，揭示了与技术性和非技术性领域相关的治理主题，补充了现有AI治理框架的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI治理框架多为高层规范，未能充分反映实际应用场景中的用户关切。

Method: 利用BERTopic分析G2.com上10万条用户评论，提取与AI治理相关的潜在主题。

Result: 发现治理主题涵盖技术与非技术领域，与现有框架有重叠，但也揭示了项目管理等被忽视的领域。

Conclusion: 强调需要基于实证、以用户为中心的AI治理方法，以补充现有规范模型。

Abstract: With the growing importance of AI governance, numerous high-level frameworks
and principles have been articulated by policymakers, institutions, and expert
communities to guide the development and application of AI. While such
frameworks offer valuable normative orientation, they may not fully capture the
practical concerns of those who interact with AI systems in organizational and
operational contexts. To address this gap, this study adopts a bottom-up
approach to explore how governance-relevant themes are expressed in user
discourse. Drawing on over 100,000 user reviews of AI products from G2.com, we
apply BERTopic to extract latent themes and identify those most semantically
related to AI governance. The analysis reveals a diverse set of
governance-relevant topics spanning both technical and non-technical domains.
These include concerns across organizational processes-such as planning,
coordination, and communication-as well as stages of the AI value chain,
including deployment infrastructure, data handling, and analytics. The findings
show considerable overlap with institutional AI governance and ethics
frameworks on issues like privacy and transparency, but also surface overlooked
areas such as project management, strategy development, and customer
interaction. This highlights the need for more empirically grounded,
user-centered approaches to AI governance-approaches that complement normative
models by capturing how governance unfolds in applied settings. By
foregrounding how governance is enacted in practice, this study contributes to
more inclusive and operationally grounded approaches to AI governance and
digital policy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过注入隐形标记（phantom tokens）的方法TRAPDOC，旨在减少用户对大型语言模型（LLM）的过度依赖和滥用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM功能的增强，用户过度依赖其完成作业、处理敏感文档等任务，导致社会问题。

Method: 通过向文档中注入隐形标记，使LLM生成看似合理但实际错误的输出，从而欺骗过度依赖的用户。

Result: 实验证明TRAPDOC在专有LLM上有效，能显著减少用户滥用行为。

Conclusion: TRAPDOC为促进用户更负责任地使用语言模型提供了基础。

Abstract: The reasoning, writing, text-editing, and retrieval capabilities of
proprietary large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly, providing users
with an ever-expanding set of functionalities. However, this growing utility
has also led to a serious societal concern: the over-reliance on LLMs. In
particular, users increasingly delegate tasks such as homework, assignments, or
the processing of sensitive documents to LLMs without meaningful engagement.
This form of over-reliance and misuse is emerging as a significant social
issue. In order to mitigate these issues, we propose a method injecting
imperceptible phantom tokens into documents, which causes LLMs to generate
outputs that appear plausible to users but are in fact incorrect. Based on this
technique, we introduce TRAPDOC, a framework designed to deceive over-reliant
LLM users. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework on proprietary LLMs, comparing its impact against several
baselines. TRAPDOC serves as a strong foundation for promoting more responsible
and thoughtful engagement with language models. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个针对肝胆胰（HPB）疾病的评估基准ClinBench-HBP，包含3535道选择题和337个真实诊断案例，揭示了当前大型语言模型（LLM）在HPB疾病诊断中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HPB疾病的高发病率和死亡率使其成为全球公共卫生挑战，但现有LLM评估基准缺乏HPB覆盖和真实临床案例。

Method: 建立包含ICD-10定义的33个主类和465个子类的HPB疾病评估基准，包括选择题和真实诊断案例，并对商业和开源LLM进行评估。

Result: 商业LLM在医学考试题上表现良好，但在HPB诊断任务中表现显著下降，尤其是复杂住院病例。医学LLM对HPB疾病的泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在HPB疾病领域存在显著局限，未来需专注于真实复杂临床诊断而非简单考试题。基准将公开发布。

Abstract: Hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) disorders represent a global public health
challenge due to their high morbidity and mortality. Although large language
models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in general medical
question-answering tasks, the current evaluation benchmarks are mostly derived
from standardized examinations or manually designed questions, lacking HPB
coverage and clinical cases. To address these issues, we systematically
eatablish an HPB disease evaluation benchmark comprising 3,535 closed-ended
multiple-choice questions and 337 open-ended real diagnosis cases, which
encompasses all the 33 main categories and 465 subcategories of HPB diseases
defined in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th
Revision (ICD-10). The multiple-choice questions are curated from public
datasets and synthesized data, and the clinical cases are collected from
prestigious medical journals, case-sharing platforms, and collaborating
hospitals. By evalauting commercial and open-source general and medical LLMs on
our established benchmark, namely ClinBench-HBP, we find that while commercial
LLMs perform competently on medical exam questions, they exhibit substantial
performance degradation on HPB diagnosis tasks, especially on complex,
inpatient clinical cases. Those medical LLMs also show limited generalizability
to HPB diseases. Our results reveal the critical limitations of current LLMs in
the domain of HPB diseases, underscoring the imperative need for future medical
LLMs to handle real, complex clinical diagnostics rather than simple medical
exam questions. The benchmark will be released at the homepage.

Motivation: 儿童在语音技术中代表性不足且隐私保护需求高，但相关匿名化技术研究较少。

Method: 使用三个儿童数据集、六种匿名化方法，结合主客观指标进行评估。

Result: 现有成人匿名化系统能保护儿童隐私，但实用性显著降低；自动评估方法在儿童语音质量上存在挑战。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究儿童语音匿名化技术，改进评估方法。

Abstract: Children are one of the most under-represented groups in speech technologies,
as well as one of the most vulnerable in terms of privacy. Despite this,
anonymization techniques targeting this population have received little
attention. In this study, we seek to bridge this gap, and establish a baseline
for the use of voice anonymization techniques designed for adult speech when
applied to children's voices. Such an evaluation is essential, as children's
speech presents a distinct set of challenges when compared to that of adults.
This study comprises three children's datasets, six anonymization methods, and
objective and subjective utility metrics for evaluation. Our results show that
existing systems for adults are still able to protect children's voice privacy,
but suffer from much higher utility degradation. In addition, our subjective
study displays the challenges of automatic evaluation methods for speech
quality in children's speech, highlighting the need for further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）的发展，其在地理信息表示中的可信度成为重要问题，研究旨在评估LLMs在地理任务中的表现。

Method: 研究通过地理编码、高程估计和反向地理编码三个任务，比较了GPT-4o和Gemini 2.0 Flash的性能。

Result: GPT-4o在地理编码中偏差较大，Gemini 2.0 Flash更精确但有系统性偏移；两者在高程估计中均低估，反向地理编码中Gemini表现更优，但均未准确重建奥地利联邦州。

Conclusion: LLMs可近似地理信息，但准确性不一致，需针对地理信息进行优化以提升其在GIScience和Geoinformatics中的实用性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, questions about their
trustworthiness in delivering factual information have become increasingly
important. This concern also applies to their ability to accurately represent
the geographic world. With recent advancements in this field, it is relevant to
consider whether and to what extent LLMs' representations of the geographical
world can be trusted. This study evaluates the performance of GPT-4o and Gemini
2.0 Flash in three key geospatial tasks: geocoding, elevation estimation, and
reverse geocoding. In the geocoding task, both models exhibited systematic and
random errors in estimating the coordinates of St. Anne's Column in Innsbruck,
Austria, with GPT-4o showing greater deviations and Gemini 2.0 Flash
demonstrating more precision but a significant systematic offset. For elevation
estimation, both models tended to underestimate elevations across Austria,
though they captured overall topographical trends, and Gemini 2.0 Flash
performed better in eastern regions. The reverse geocoding task, which involved
identifying Austrian federal states from coordinates, revealed that Gemini 2.0
Flash outperformed GPT-4o in overall accuracy and F1-scores, demonstrating
better consistency across regions. Despite these findings, neither model
achieved an accurate reconstruction of Austria's federal states, highlighting
persistent misclassifications. The study concludes that while LLMs can
approximate geographic information, their accuracy and reliability are
inconsistent, underscoring the need for fine-tuning with geographical
information to enhance their utility in GIScience and Geoinformatics.

Abstract: Understanding the prevalence of misinformation in health topics online can
inform public health policies and interventions. However, measuring such
misinformation at scale remains a challenge, particularly for high-stakes but
understudied topics like opioid-use disorder (OUD)--a leading cause of death in
the U.S. We present the first large-scale study of OUD-related myths on
YouTube, a widely-used platform for health information. With clinical experts,
we validate 8 pervasive myths and release an expert-labeled video dataset. To
scale labeling, we introduce MythTriage, an efficient triage pipeline that uses
a lightweight model for routine cases and defers harder ones to a
high-performing, but costlier, large language model (LLM). MythTriage achieves
up to 0.86 macro F1-score while estimated to reduce annotation time and
financial cost by over 76% compared to experts and full LLM labeling. We
analyze 2.9K search results and 343K recommendations, uncovering how myths
persist on YouTube and offering actionable insights for public health and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的普及，确保其符合人类价值观至关重要。现有对齐方法（如CAI）缺乏动态修订和程序合法性。

Method: 采用广泛反思平衡方法（MWRE），通过协调道德判断、原则和背景理论，提升对齐的动态性和伦理合理性。

Result: MWRE为LLM对齐提供了更稳健的伦理框架，优于现有基础主义方法。

Conclusion: MWRE可作为分析和改进LLM对齐的有力工具，推动更符合伦理的AI发展。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more powerful and pervasive across
society, ensuring these systems are beneficial, safe, and aligned with human
values is crucial. Current alignment techniques, like Constitutional AI (CAI),
involve complex iterative processes. This paper argues that the Method of Wide
Reflective Equilibrium (MWRE) -- a well-established coherentist moral
methodology -- offers a uniquely apt framework for understanding current LLM
alignment efforts. Moreover, this methodology can substantively augment these
processes by providing concrete pathways for improving their dynamic
revisability, procedural legitimacy, and overall ethical grounding. Together,
these enhancements can help produce more robust and ethically defensible
outcomes. MWRE, emphasizing the achievement of coherence between our considered
moral judgments, guiding moral principles, and relevant background theories,
arguably better represents the intricate reality of LLM alignment and offers a
more robust path to justification than prevailing foundationalist models or
simplistic input-output evaluations. While current methods like CAI bear a
structural resemblance to MWRE, they often lack its crucial emphasis on
dynamic, bi-directional revision of principles and the procedural legitimacy
derived from such a process. While acknowledging various disanalogies (e.g.,
consciousness, genuine understanding in LLMs), the paper demonstrates that MWRE
serves as a valuable heuristic for critically analyzing current alignment
efforts and for guiding the future development of more ethically sound and
justifiably aligned AI systems.

Conclusion: 强调电信LLMs需关注安全对齐，提供诊断研究和实用指南，确保实际部署中的安全性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for telecom tasks and datasets is a
common practice to adapt general-purpose models to the telecom domain. However,
little attention has been paid to how this process may compromise model safety.
Recent research has shown that even benign fine-tuning can degrade the safety
alignment of LLMs, causing them to respond to harmful or unethical user
queries. In this paper, we investigate this issue for telecom-tuned LLMs using
three representative datasets featured by the GenAINet initiative. We show that
safety degradation persists even for structured and seemingly harmless datasets
such as 3GPP standards and tabular records, indicating that telecom-specific
data is not immune to safety erosion during fine-tuning. We further extend our
analysis to publicly available Telecom LLMs trained via continual pre-training,
revealing that safety alignment is often severely lacking, primarily due to the
omission of safety-focused instruction tuning. To address these issues in both
fine-tuned and pre-trained models, we conduct extensive experiments and
evaluate three safety realignment defenses (SafeInstruct, SafeLoRA, and
SafeMERGE) using established red-teaming benchmarks. The results show that,
across all settings, the proposed defenses can effectively restore safety after
harmful degradation without compromising downstream task performance, leading
to Safe teleCOMMunication (SafeCOMM) models. In a nutshell, our work serves as
a diagnostic study and practical guide for safety realignment in telecom-tuned
LLMs, and emphasizes the importance of safety-aware instruction and fine-tuning
for real-world deployments of Telecom LLMs.

Motivation: 现代奴隶制法要求企业披露反奴隶制措施，但声明语言复杂且数量庞大，验证困难，且缺乏标注数据。

Method: 与领域专家合作，构建跨司法管辖区数据集（AIMS.uk和AIMS.ca），并开发AIMSCheck框架，将合规评估分为三个层次。

Result: 实验表明，基于澳大利亚数据训练的模型在英加司法管辖区表现良好，具备泛化潜力。

Conclusion: 发布数据集和框架以推动AI在合规评估中的应用及进一步研究。

Abstract: Modern Slavery Acts mandate that corporations disclose their efforts to
combat modern slavery, aiming to enhance transparency and strengthen practices
for its eradication. However, verifying these statements remains challenging
due to their complex, diversified language and the sheer number of statements
that must be reviewed. The development of NLP tools to assist in this task is
also difficult due to a scarcity of annotated data. Furthermore, as modern
slavery transparency legislation has been introduced in several countries, the
generalizability of such tools across legal jurisdictions must be studied. To
address these challenges, we work with domain experts to make two key
contributions. First, we present AIMS.uk and AIMS.ca, newly annotated datasets
from the UK and Canada to enable cross-jurisdictional evaluation. Second, we
introduce AIMSCheck, an end-to-end framework for compliance validation.
AIMSCheck decomposes the compliance assessment task into three levels,
enhancing interpretability and practical applicability. Our experiments show
that models trained on an Australian dataset generalize well across UK and
Canadian jurisdictions, demonstrating the potential for broader application in
compliance monitoring. We release the benchmark datasets and AIMSCheck to the

research in this field.

TL;DR: 本文首次在可解释AI中提出了严格的‘可争议性’定义，并开发了一个模块化框架和评估量表，以帮助实践者满足监管要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球AI监管对系统安全性的关注增加，‘可争议性’成为一项强制性但定义模糊的保障措施。目前缺乏正式定义和具体指导。

Method: 通过系统文献综述，提出‘可争议性’的正式定义，并开发了一个模块化框架和‘可争议性评估量表’。

Result: 通过多领域案例研究，揭示了现有系统的不足，并展示了框架如何推动改进。

Conclusion: 本研究将‘可争议性’从理论转化为实践工具，为AI系统提供了真正的追责和问责机制。

Abstract: As AI regulations around the world intensify their focus on system safety,
contestability has become a mandatory, yet ill-defined, safeguard. In XAI,
"contestability" remains an empty promise: no formal definition exists, no
algorithm guarantees it, and practitioners lack concrete guidance to satisfy
regulatory requirements. Grounded in a systematic literature review, this paper
presents the first rigorous formal definition of contestability in explainable
AI, directly aligned with stakeholder requirements and regulatory mandates. We
introduce a modular framework of by-design and post-hoc mechanisms spanning
human-centered interfaces, technical architectures, legal processes, and
organizational workflows. To operationalize our framework, we propose the
Contestability Assessment Scale, a composite metric built on more than twenty
quantitative criteria. Through multiple case studies across diverse application
domains, we reveal where state-of-the-art systems fall short and show how our
framework drives targeted improvements. By converting contestability from
regulatory theory into a practical framework, our work equips practitioners
with the tools to embed genuine recourse and accountability into AI systems.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文探讨了STPA方法在提升前沿AI系统安全性中的应用，通过系统性分析识别潜在风险，补充现有AI治理技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿AI公司缺乏详细的结构化方法来识别和分析风险，STPA作为一种系统性方法，可能提升安全性和可扩展性。

Method: 应用STPA方法分析AI系统的控制流程和反馈循环，识别不安全控制行为及其潜在损失场景。

Result: STPA能发现非结构化方法可能遗漏的因果因素，增强安全性的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: STPA可作为现有AI治理技术的补充，提升安全保证，并支持通过LLMs实现分析的可扩展性。

Abstract: All of the frontier AI companies have published safety frameworks where they
define capability thresholds and risk mitigations that determine how they will
safely develop and deploy their models. Adoption of systematic approaches to
risk modelling, based on established practices used in safety-critical
industries, has been recommended, however frontier AI companies currently do
not describe in detail any structured approach to identifying and analysing
hazards. STPA (Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis) is a systematic methodology
for identifying how complex systems can become unsafe, leading to hazards. It
achieves this by mapping out controllers and controlled processes then
analysing their interactions and feedback loops to understand how harmful
outcomes could occur (Leveson & Thomas, 2018). We evaluate STPA's ability to
broaden the scope, improve traceability and strengthen the robustness of safety
assurance for frontier AI systems. Applying STPA to the threat model and
scenario described in 'A Sketch of an AI Control Safety Case' (Korbak et al.,
2025), we derive a list of Unsafe Control Actions. From these we select a
subset and explore the Loss Scenarios that lead to them if left unmitigated. We
find that STPA is able to identify causal factors that may be missed by
unstructured hazard analysis methodologies thereby improving robustness. We
suggest STPA could increase the safety assurance of frontier AI when used to
complement or check coverage of existing AI governance techniques including
capability thresholds, model evaluations and emergency procedures. The
application of a systematic methodology supports scalability by increasing the
proportion of the analysis that could be conducted by LLMs, reducing the burden
on human domain experts.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个框架和分类法，用于分析企业在面对欧盟AI法案（AIA）时可能采取的“规避”行为，即介于合法避税与非法逃税之间的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是为企业提供一种对抗性框架，以“红队”方式测试AIA及未来AI法规的漏洞。

Method: 通过将规避策略分为三个“层级”（AIA适用范围、豁免条款、高监管类别），并分析每种策略的组织和技术表现形式。

Result: 提出了一个系统化的框架，用于识别和分类企业在不同AIA监管层级下可能采取的规避行为。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于预见和应对企业在AIA监管下的潜在规避行为，为政策制定者提供参考。

Abstract: The shape of AI regulation is beginning to emerge, most prominently through
the EU AI Act (the "AIA"). By 2027, the AIA will be in full effect, and firms
are starting to adjust their behavior in light of this new law. In this paper,
we present a framework and taxonomy for reasoning about "avoision" -- conduct
that walks the line between legal avoidance and evasion -- that firms might
engage in so as to minimize the regulatory burden the AIA poses. We organize
these avoision strategies around three "tiers" of increasing AIA exposure that
regulated entities face depending on: whether their activities are (1) within
scope of the AIA, (2) exempted from provisions of the AIA, or are (3) placed in
a category with higher regulatory scrutiny. In each of these tiers and for each
strategy, we specify the organizational and technological forms through which
avoision may manifest. Our goal is to provide an adversarial framework for "red
teaming" the AIA and AI regulation on the horizon.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MultiFakeVerse，一个大规模、基于视觉语言模型（VLM）生成的人为中心深度伪造数据集，包含845,286张图像，旨在填补现有深度伪造数据集的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度伪造研究缺乏大规模且具有语义推理能力的数据集，特别是针对人、场景和上下文操作的。

Method: 利用VLM生成语义和上下文感知的图像修改，如动作、场景和人-物交互的调整，而非简单的身份替换或局部编辑。

Result: 实验表明，现有深度伪造检测模型和人类观察者难以识别这些细微但有意义的修改。

Conclusion: MultiFakeVerse为深度伪造检测研究提供了新的挑战和资源。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GenAI technology over the past few years has
significantly contributed towards highly realistic deepfake content generation.
Despite ongoing efforts, the research community still lacks a large-scale and
reasoning capability driven deepfake benchmark dataset specifically tailored
for person-centric object, context and scene manipulations. In this paper, we
address this gap by introducing MultiFakeVerse, a large scale person-centric
deepfake dataset, comprising 845,286 images generated through manipulation
suggestions and image manipulations both derived from vision-language models
(VLM). The VLM instructions were specifically targeted towards modifications to
individuals or contextual elements of a scene that influence human perception
of importance, intent, or narrative. This VLM-driven approach enables semantic,
context-aware alterations such as modifying actions, scenes, and human-object
interactions rather than synthetic or low-level identity swaps and
region-specific edits that are common in existing datasets. Our experiments
reveal that current state-of-the-art deepfake detection models and human
observers struggle to detect these subtle yet meaningful manipulations. The
code and dataset are available on

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: MOVDA是一种改进传统评分系统的方法，通过利用真实胜利分差与模型预期之间的差异，提供更精确的技能评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如ELO仅关注二元结果，忽略了胜利分差等关键信息，MOVDA旨在填补这一空白。

Method: MOVDA通过领域特定的非线性函数预测预期胜利分差，并利用真实与预期分差的差异更新评分。

Result: 在NBA数据上，MOVDA显著优于ELO和贝叶斯基线，提升预测准确性和收敛速度。

Conclusion: MOVDA为竞争环境提供了一种理论扎实、实证优越且计算高效的技能评分方法。

Abstract: Knowledge of accurate relative skills in any competitive system is essential,
but foundational approaches such as ELO discard extremely relevant performance
data by concentrating exclusively on binary outcomes. While margin of victory
(MOV) extensions exist, they often lack a definitive method for incorporating
this information. We introduce Margin of Victory Differential Analysis (MOVDA),
a framework that enhances traditional rating systems by using the deviation
between the true MOV and a $\textit{modeled expectation}$. MOVDA learns a
domain-specific, non-linear function (a scaled hyperbolic tangent that captures
saturation effects and home advantage) to predict expected MOV based on rating
differentials. Crucially, the $\textit{difference}$ between the true and
expected MOV provides a subtle and weighted signal for rating updates,
highlighting informative deviations in all levels of contests. Extensive
experiments on professional NBA basketball data (from 2013 to 2023, with 13,619
games) show that MOVDA significantly outperforms standard ELO and Bayesian
baselines. MOVDA reduces Brier score prediction error by $1.54\%$ compared to
TrueSkill, increases outcome accuracy by $0.58\%$, and most importantly
accelerates rating convergence by $13.5\%$, while maintaining the computational
efficiency of the original ELO updates. MOVDA offers a theoretically motivated,
empirically superior, and computationally lean approach to integrating
performance magnitude into skill rating for competitive environments like the
NBA.

Motivation: 癌症是一种遗传疾病，基因和表观遗传改变导致基因表达异常。高维微阵列数据分类面临“小样本大特征”问题，容易过拟合。

Method: 1) 结合FSWOR技术和投影方法；2) 使用Kendall统计检验筛选显著基因；3) 应用集成分类器和LDA投影与朴素贝叶斯模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提高了高维基因表达数据的分类准确性，为癌症生物标志物发现提供了新工具。

Abstract: Cancer is fundamentally a genetic disease characterized by genetic and
epigenetic alterations that disrupt normal gene expression, leading to
uncontrolled cell growth and metastasis. High-dimensional microarray datasets
pose challenges for classification models due to the "small n, large p"
problem, resulting in overfitting. This study makes three different key
contributions: 1) we propose a machine learning-based approach integrating the
Feature Selection Without Re-placement (FSWOR) technique and a projection
method to improve classification accuracy. 2) We apply the Kendall statistical
test to identify the most significant genes from the brain cancer mi-croarray
dataset (GSE50161), reducing the feature space from 54,675 to 20,890 genes.3)
we apply machine learning models using k-fold cross validation techniques in
which our model incorpo-rates ensemble classifiers with LDA projection and
Na\"ive Bayes, achieving a test score of 96%, outperforming existing methods by
9.09%. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our ap-proach in
high-dimensional gene expression analysis, improving classification accuracy
while mitigating overfitting. This study contributes to cancer biomarker
discovery, offering a robust computational method for analyzing microarray

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于渐进视图范式的3D编辑方法Pro3D-Editor，通过动态采样主视图、传播编辑语义到关键视图，并优化多视图编辑，实现了更准确和一致的3D编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多视图编辑中存在不一致性问题，忽视了视图间的依赖关系，因此需要一种更有效的方法来实现一致的3D编辑。

Method: Pro3D-Editor框架包括主视图采样器（动态选择编辑显著视图）、关键视图渲染器（通过MoVE-LoRA传播语义）和全视图优化器（基于多视图编辑优化3D对象）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在编辑准确性和空间一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 渐进视图范式结合Pro3D-Editor框架能够有效解决多视图3D编辑的一致性问题。

Abstract: Text-guided 3D editing aims to precisely edit semantically relevant local 3D
regions, which has significant potential for various practical applications
ranging from 3D games to film production. Existing methods typically follow a
view-indiscriminate paradigm: editing 2D views indiscriminately and projecting
them back into 3D space. However, they overlook the different cross-view
interdependencies, resulting in inconsistent multi-view editing. In this study,
we argue that ideal consistent 3D editing can be achieved through a
\textit{progressive-views paradigm}, which propagates editing semantics from
the editing-salient view to other editing-sparse views. Specifically, we
propose \textit{Pro3D-Editor}, a novel framework, which mainly includes
Primary-view Sampler, Key-view Render, and Full-view Refiner. Primary-view
Sampler dynamically samples and edits the most editing-salient view as the
primary view. Key-view Render accurately propagates editing semantics from the
primary view to other key views through its Mixture-of-View-Experts Low-Rank
Adaption (MoVE-LoRA). Full-view Refiner edits and refines the 3D object based
on the edited multi-views. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing methods in editing accuracy and spatial consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经方法在分布表示上无法同时实现快速和表达力强，因此需要一种简单但有效的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 将2D方向域分布分解为两个1D概率分布函数，用神经网络建模离散坐标的分布，并通过插值评估和采样。训练时最大化学习分布与目标分布的相似性，并使用额外网络缓存入射辐射以减少梯度方差。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在复杂光传输场景中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在表达力和速度之间取得了良好平衡，适用于复杂渲染任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural path guiding method to aid with Monte
Carlo (MC) integration in rendering. Existing neural methods utilize
distribution representations that are either fast or expressive, but not both.
We propose a simple, but effective, representation that is sufficiently
expressive and reasonably fast. Specifically, we break down the 2D distribution
over the directional domain into two 1D probability distribution functions
(PDF). We propose to model each 1D PDF using a neural network that estimates
the distribution at a set of discrete coordinates. The PDF at an arbitrary
location can then be evaluated and sampled through interpolation. To train the
network, we maximize the similarity of the learned and target distributions. To
reduce the variance of the gradient during optimizations and estimate the
normalization factor, we propose to cache the incoming radiance using an
additional network. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our
approach is better than the existing methods, particularly in challenging
scenes with complex light transport.

TL;DR: LensCraft提出了一种数据驱动的方法，结合电影摄影原则和实时动态场景适应能力，解决了自动化拍摄系统中机械执行与创意意图之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字创作者在将创意转化为精确相机运动时面临瓶颈，现有系统忽略了主体的方向和体积，限制了空间感知。

Method: 使用专业模拟框架生成高保真训练数据，结合高级神经模型，支持多种输入模态（如文本提示、轨迹、关键点等）。

Result: 在静态和动态场景中表现出前所未有的准确性和连贯性，计算复杂度低且推理速度快。

Conclusion: LensCraft为智能相机系统设定了新标准，提供了灵活且高质量的工具。

Abstract: Digital creators, from indie filmmakers to animation studios, face a
persistent bottleneck: translating their creative vision into precise camera
movements. Despite significant progress in computer vision and artificial
intelligence, current automated filming systems struggle with a fundamental
trade-off between mechanical execution and creative intent. Crucially, almost
all previous works simplify the subject to a single point-ignoring its
orientation and true volume-severely limiting spatial awareness during filming.
LensCraft solves this problem by mimicking the expertise of a professional
cinematographer, using a data-driven approach that combines cinematographic
principles with the flexibility to adapt to dynamic scenes in real time. Our
solution combines a specialized simulation framework for generating
high-fidelity training data with an advanced neural model that is faithful to
the script while being aware of the volume and dynamic behavior of the subject.
Additionally, our approach allows for flexible control via various input
modalities, including text prompts, subject trajectory and volume, key points,
or a full camera trajectory, offering creators a versatile tool to guide camera
movements in line with their vision. Leveraging a lightweight real time
architecture, LensCraft achieves markedly lower computational complexity and
faster inference while maintaining high output quality. Extensive evaluation
across static and dynamic scenarios reveals unprecedented accuracy and
coherence, setting a new benchmark for intelligent camera systems compared to
state-of-the-art models. Extended results, the complete dataset, simulation
environment, trained model weights, and source code are publicly accessible on

Motivation: 现代影视、游戏和AR/VR中视觉效果的创作需要专业知识和耗时操作，现有生成方法计算量大且速度慢。

Method: 将3D动画重新定义为场预测任务，利用LLM和VLM生成函数，通过文本提示实时更新3D高斯的属性。

Result: 实验表明，简单的文本指令即可生成动态视觉效果，大幅减少手动操作和建模需求。

Conclusion: 该方法为语言驱动的3D内容创作提供了快速且易用的途径，有助于进一步普及视觉效果制作。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are key to immersion in modern films, games, and AR/VR.
Creating 3D effects requires specialized expertise and training in 3D animation
software and can be time consuming. Generative solutions typically rely on
computationally intense methods such as diffusion models which can be slow at
4D inference. We reformulate 3D animation as a field prediction task and
introduce a text-driven framework that infers a time-varying 4D flow field
acting on 3D Gaussians. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs) for function generation, our approach interprets
arbitrary prompts (e.g., "make the vase glow orange, then explode") and
instantly updates color, opacity, and positions of 3D Gaussians in real time.
This design avoids overheads such as mesh extraction, manual or physics-based
simulations and allows both novice and expert users to animate volumetric
scenes with minimal effort on a consumer device even in a web browser.
Experimental results show that simple textual instructions suffice to generate
compelling time-varying VFX, reducing the manual effort typically required for
rigging or advanced modeling. We thus present a fast and accessible pathway to
language-driven 3D content creation that can pave the way to democratize VFX
further.

Motivation: 基于LDM的说话头动画技术可能被滥用于诈骗、政治操纵和虚假信息，现有防御方法无法有效保护肖像隐私，因此需要更强大的解决方案。

Method: 提出Silencer方法，包括两个阶段：1）使用无效化损失忽略音频控制；2）应用抗纯化损失优化潜在特征以生成鲁棒扰动。

Result: 实验证明Silencer能有效保护肖像隐私，防止高级图像到视频动画的操纵。

Conclusion: Silencer为AI安全社区提供了对抗说话头动画技术伦理问题的有效工具，呼吁关注相关伦理风险。

Abstract: Advances in talking-head animation based on Latent Diffusion Models (LDM)
enable the creation of highly realistic, synchronized videos. These fabricated
videos are indistinguishable from real ones, increasing the risk of potential
misuse for scams, political manipulation, and misinformation. Hence, addressing
these ethical concerns has become a pressing issue in AI security. Recent
proactive defense studies focused on countering LDM-based models by adding
perturbations to portraits. However, these methods are ineffective at
protecting reference portraits from advanced image-to-video animation. The
limitations are twofold: 1) they fail to prevent images from being manipulated
by audio signals, and 2) diffusion-based purification techniques can
effectively eliminate protective perturbations. To address these challenges, we
propose Silencer, a two-stage method designed to proactively protect the
privacy of portraits. First, a nullifying loss is proposed to ignore audio
control in talking-head generation. Second, we apply anti-purification loss in
LDM to optimize the inverted latent feature to generate robust perturbations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Silencer in proactively
protecting portrait privacy. We hope this work will raise awareness among the
AI security community regarding critical ethical issues related to talking-head
generation techniques. Code: https://github.com/yuangan/Silencer.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种挑战性提示下显著提高了图像生成与文本提示的对齐度。

Conclusion: 通过阶段感知的提示分解，实现了对语义的精细控制和矛盾场景下的准确图像生成。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse
images from natural language prompts. However, they often fail to produce
semantically accurate results when the prompt contains concept combinations
that contradict their learned priors. We define this failure mode as contextual
contradiction, where one concept implicitly negates another due to entangled
associations learned during training. To address this, we propose a stage-aware
prompt decomposition framework that guides the denoising process using a
sequence of proxy prompts. Each proxy prompt is constructed to match the
semantic content expected to emerge at a specific stage of denoising, while
ensuring contextual coherence. To construct these proxy prompts, we leverage a
large language model (LLM) to analyze the target prompt, identify
contradictions, and generate alternative expressions that preserve the original
intent while resolving contextual conflicts. By aligning prompt information
with the denoising progression, our method enables fine-grained semantic
control and accurate image generation in the presence of contextual
contradictions. Experiments across a variety of challenging prompts show
substantial improvements in alignment to the textual prompt.

Our study finds geometric patterns of pollution-indicated transport networks

and the avoidance of extreme clustering coefficient are identified as
beneficial for alleviated pollution. As a graph-only study, it informs superior
urban planning by separating the impact of permanent infrastructure from that

Abstract: Designing protein sequences that fold into a target 3D structure, known as
protein inverse folding, is a fundamental challenge in protein engineering.
While recent deep learning methods have achieved impressive performance by
recovering native sequences, they often overlook the one-to-many nature of the
problem: multiple diverse sequences can fold into the same structure. This
motivates the need for a generative model capable of designing diverse
sequences while preserving structural consistency. To address this trade-off,
we introduce ProtInvTree, the first reward-guided tree-search framework for
protein inverse folding. ProtInvTree reformulates sequence generation as a
deliberate, step-wise decision-making process, enabling the exploration of
multiple design paths and exploitation of promising candidates through
self-evaluation, lookahead, and backtracking. We propose a two-stage
focus-and-grounding action mechanism that decouples position selection and
residue generation. To efficiently evaluate intermediate states, we introduce a
jumpy denoising strategy that avoids full rollouts. Built upon pretrained
protein language models, ProtInvTree supports flexible test-time scaling by
expanding the search depth and breadth without retraining. Empirically,
ProtInvTree outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks,
generating structurally consistent yet diverse sequences, including those far
from the native ground truth.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种改进的移动接受超启发式算法，通过马尔可夫链和仅接受恶化解的算子，显著提高了在多种基准函数上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进现有的移动接受超启发式算法，以更高效地逃离局部最优解，并在经典基准函数上验证其性能。

Method: 1. 使用两状态马尔可夫链选择算子；2. 引入仅接受恶化解的算子。

Result: 在Jump函数上，运行时间从Ω(n^(2m-1))降至O(n^(m+1))；在SEQOPT_k类函数上，运行时间为O(n^(k+1) log n)。

Conclusion: 改进后的算法在逃离局部最优解方面表现出色，适用于包含多种复杂函数的基准类。

Abstract: The move-acceptance hyper-heuristic was recently shown to be able to leave
local optima with astonishing efficiency (Lissovoi et al., Artificial
Intelligence (2023)). In this work, we propose two modifications to this
algorithm that demonstrate impressive performances on a large class of
benchmarks including the classic Cliff$_d$ and Jump$_m$ function classes. (i)
Instead of randomly choosing between the only-improving and any-move acceptance
operator, we take this choice via a simple two-state Markov chain. This
modification alone reduces the runtime on Jump$_m$ functions with gap parameter
$m$ from $\Omega(n^{2m-1})$ to $O(n^{m+1})$. (ii) We then replace the all-moves
acceptance operator with the operator that only accepts worsenings. Such a,
counter-intuitive, operator has not been used before in the literature.
However, our proofs show that our only-worsening operator can greatly help in
leaving local optima, reducing, e.g., the runtime on Jump functions to $O(n^3
\log n)$ independent of the gap size. In general, we prove a remarkably good
runtime of $O(n^{k+1} \log n)$ for our Markov move-acceptance hyper-heuristic
on all members of a new benchmark class SEQOPT$_k$, which contains a large
number of functions having $k$ successive local optima, and which contains the
commonly studied Jump$_m$ and Cliff$_d$ functions for $k=2$.

Motivation: 尽管对记忆的生物学基础已有大量研究，但大脑如何编码、存储和检索经验的机制仍不完全清楚。论文旨在填补这一空白，通过整合生物学发现和计算模型，为记忆研究提供更全面的理论基础。

Method: 论文综合了细胞神经科学的见解和计算建模方法，探讨了记忆痕迹神经元的识别与操纵、突触可塑性机制对稳定记忆痕迹的贡献，以及稀疏性如何促进高效且抗干扰的记忆表征。

Conclusion: 论文为未来记忆机制的研究提出了路线图，并对记忆相关疾病的诊断和治疗具有潜在意义。

Abstract: Despite substantial research into the biological basis of memory, the precise
mechanisms by which experiences are encoded, stored, and retrieved in the brain
remain incompletely understood. A growing body of evidence supports the engram
theory, which posits that sparse populations of neurons undergo lasting
physical and biochemical changes to support long-term memory. Yet, a
comprehensive computational framework that integrates biological findings with
mechanistic models remains elusive. This work synthesizes insights from
cellular neuroscience and computational modeling to address key challenges in
engram research: how engram neurons are identified and manipulated; how
synaptic plasticity mechanisms contribute to stable memory traces; and how
sparsity promotes efficient, interference-resistant representations. Relevant
computational approaches -- such as sparse regularization, engram gating, and
biologically inspired architectures like Sparse Distributed Memory and spiking
neural networks -- are also examined. Together, these findings suggest that
memory efficiency, capacity, and stability emerge from the interaction of
plasticity and sparsity constraints. By integrating neurobiological and
computational perspectives, this paper provides a comprehensive theoretical
foundation for engram research and proposes a roadmap for future inquiry into
the mechanisms underlying memory, with implications for the diagnosis and
treatment of memory-related disorders.

Motivation: 传统监督微调（SFT）方法在机器人控制中存在数据集构造启发式、灾难性遗忘和泛化性能下降等问题。

Method: Robot-R1通过强化学习预测任务完成所需的关键点状态，结合场景图像和环境元数据，采样并强化推理响应。

Result: 实验显示，Robot-R1在具身推理任务中优于SFT方法，甚至在低层动作控制任务上超越GPT-4o。

Conclusion: Robot-R1为机器人控制中的具身推理提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown great promise in
advancing robotics by combining embodied reasoning with robot control. A common
approach involves training on embodied reasoning tasks related to robot control
using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, SFT datasets are often
heuristically constructed and not explicitly optimized for improving robot
control. Furthermore, SFT often leads to issues such as catastrophic forgetting
and reduced generalization performance. To address these limitations, we
introduce Robot-R1, a novel framework that leverages reinforcement learning to
enhance embodied reasoning specifically for robot control. Robot-R1 learns to
predict the next keypoint state required for task completion, conditioned on
the current scene image and environment metadata derived from expert
demonstrations. Inspired by the DeepSeek-R1 learning approach, Robot-R1 samples
reasoning-based responses and reinforces those that lead to more accurate
predictions. Our experiments show that models trained with Robot-R1 outperform
SFT methods on embodied reasoning tasks. Despite having only 7B parameters,
Robot-R1 even surpasses GPT-4o on reasoning tasks related to low-level action
control, such as spatial and primitive movement reasoning.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, in industrial

platform, detailing how a simulated mobile robot responds to text and voice

decreasing the communication latency by 7.01\% on average. Such improvements
facilitate smoother, real-time robot operations, which are crucial for
industrial automation and precision tasks.

Motivation: 解决现有方法（如拓扑图或密集神经表示）在动态环境中建模不足或计算成本高的问题。

Method: 构建全局拓扑图和动态子图，通过语义和空间约束结合，利用大语言模型（LLM）生成可执行指令。

Result: 实验验证了Hi-Dyna Graph在场景表示和任务完成上的优越性，实际部署中机器人能自主完成复杂任务。

Conclusion: Hi-Dyna Graph为动态环境中的机器人自主操作提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous operation of service robotics in human-centric scenes remains
challenging due to the need for understanding of changing environments and
context-aware decision-making. While existing approaches like topological maps
offer efficient spatial priors, they fail to model transient object
relationships, whereas dense neural representations (e.g., NeRF) incur
prohibitive computational costs. Inspired by the hierarchical scene
representation and video scene graph generation works, we propose Hi-Dyna
Graph, a hierarchical dynamic scene graph architecture that integrates
persistent global layouts with localized dynamic semantics for embodied robotic
autonomy. Our framework constructs a global topological graph from posed RGB-D
inputs, encoding room-scale connectivity and large static objects (e.g.,
furniture), while environmental and egocentric cameras populate dynamic
subgraphs with object position relations and human-object interaction patterns.
A hybrid architecture is conducted by anchoring these subgraphs to the global
topology using semantic and spatial constraints, enabling seamless updates as
the environment evolves. An agent powered by large language models (LLMs) is
employed to interpret the unified graph, infer latent task triggers, and
generate executable instructions grounded in robotic affordances. We conduct
complex experiments to demonstrate Hi-Dyna Grap's superior scene representation
effectiveness. Real-world deployments validate the system's practicality with a
mobile manipulator: robotics autonomously complete complex tasks with no
further training or complex rewarding in a dynamic scene as cafeteria
assistant. See https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Hi-Dyna-Graph-B326 for video

Motivation: 现实世界中的具身智能体需要处理长时程任务，现有方法在任务规划和动作控制上存在不足，限制了性能。

Method: LoHoVLA利用预训练视觉语言模型生成语言和动作标记，结合分层闭环控制机制，减少规划和动作错误。

Result: 在Ravens模拟器中，LoHoVLA在20个长时程任务上显著优于分层和标准VLA方法。

Conclusion: 统一架构在提升具身智能的通用性方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Real-world embodied agents face long-horizon tasks, characterized by
high-level goals demanding multi-step solutions beyond single actions.
Successfully navigating these requires both high-level task planning (i.e.,
decomposing goals into sub-tasks) and low-level motion control (i.e.,
generating precise robot actions). While existing vision language action (VLA)
models and hierarchical architectures offer potential in embodied tasks, the
former often falter in planning, and the latter can suffer from coordination
issues, both hampering performance. We introduce a new unified VLA framework
for long-horizon tasks, dubbed LoHoVLA, to overcome these limitations. LoHoVLA
leverages a large pretrained vision language model (VLM) as the backbone to
jointly generate language and action tokens for sub-task generation and robot
action prediction, respectively. This shared representation promotes better
generalization across tasks. Additionally, LoHoVLA embraces a hierarchical
closed-loop control mechanism to mitigate errors originating from both
high-level planning and low-level control. To train LoHoVLA, we introduce
LoHoSet, a dataset built on the Ravens simulator, containing 20 long-horizon
tasks, each with 1,000 expert demonstrations composed of visual observations,
linguistic goals, sub-tasks, and robot actions. Experimental results show that
LoHoVLA significantly surpasses both hierarchical and standard VLA approaches
on long-horizon embodied tasks in the Ravens simulator. These findings
underscore the promise of unified architectures for advancing generalizable
embodied intelligence.

Result: 在NAVSIM和Bench2Drive基准测试中验证了框架的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GaussianFusion提供了一种高效且直观的多传感器融合方法，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的性能。

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion is crucial for improving the performance and robustness
of end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing methods predominantly adopt
either attention-based flatten fusion or bird's eye view fusion through
geometric transformations. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
interpretability or dense computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce
GaussianFusion, a Gaussian-based multi-sensor fusion framework for end-to-end
autonomous driving. Our method employs intuitive and compact Gaussian
representations as intermediate carriers to aggregate information from diverse
sensors. Specifically, we initialize a set of 2D Gaussians uniformly across the
driving scene, where each Gaussian is parameterized by physical attributes and
equipped with explicit and implicit features. These Gaussians are progressively
refined by integrating multi-modal features. The explicit features capture rich
semantic and spatial information about the traffic scene, while the implicit
features provide complementary cues beneficial for trajectory planning. To
fully exploit rich spatial and semantic information in Gaussians, we design a
cascade planning head that iteratively refines trajectory predictions through
interactions with Gaussians. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and
Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the
proposed GaussianFusion framework. The source code will be released at
https://github.com/Say2L/GaussianFusion.

Result: GBC在GBC-100K数据集上生成了更多样化和高质量的人类运动，运动时长比现有方法长10倍。

Conclusion: GBC为未来人类行为建模研究奠定了基础，数据集和源代码将公开。

Abstract: Human motion generative modeling or synthesis aims to characterize
complicated human motions of daily activities in diverse real-world
environments. However, current research predominantly focuses on either
low-level, short-period motions or high-level action planning, without taking
into account the hierarchical goal-oriented nature of human activities. In this
work, we take a step forward from human motion generation to human behavior
modeling, which is inspired by cognitive science. We present a unified
framework, dubbed Generative Behavior Control (GBC), to model diverse human
motions driven by various high-level intentions by aligning motions with
hierarchical behavior plans generated by large language models (LLMs). Our
insight is that human motions can be jointly controlled by task and motion
planning in robotics, but guided by LLMs to achieve improved motion diversity
and physical fidelity. Meanwhile, to overcome the limitations of existing
benchmarks, i.e., lack of behavioral plans, we propose GBC-100K dataset
annotated with a hierarchical granularity of semantic and motion plans driven
by target goals. Our experiments demonstrate that GBC can generate more diverse
and purposeful high-quality human motions with 10* longer horizons compared
with existing methods when trained on GBC-100K, laying a foundation for future
research on behavioral modeling of human motions. Our dataset and source code
will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Effective robotic autonomy in unknown environments demands proactive

paper, we propose ActiveSGM, an active semantic mapping framework designed to
predict the informativeness of potential observations before execution. Built
upon a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) mapping backbone, our approach employs
semantic and geometric uncertainty quantification, coupled with a sparse

strategically select the most beneficial viewpoints, ActiveSGM efficiently
enhances mapping completeness, accuracy, and robustness to noisy semantic data,
ultimately supporting more adaptive scene exploration. Our experiments on the

Abstract: Robotic odour source localization (OSL) is a critical capability for
autonomous systems operating in complex environments. However, current OSL
methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute
odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor
resolutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning
method using diffusion-based molecular generation to enhance odour localization
accuracy that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset
construction pipelines with vision-language models (VLMs) This generative
process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the
limitations of both current olfactory datasets and the training data of VLMs,
enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously
documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using
advanced olfactory sensors which emulate human olfactory recognition through
electronic sensor arrays. By integrating visual analysis, language processing,
and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of
olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their
correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making in
environments where olfactory cues are essential. Our methodology represents a
foundational advancement in the field of robotic olfaction, offering a scalable
solution to the challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor
ambiguities.

Motivation: Fin-Ray夹持器在适应性和抓取性能上表现优异，但建模其非线性抓取力和变形行为具有挑战性，且高力和精细操作之间存在矛盾。

Method: 采用FEM估计Fin-Ray的变形和接触力，构建MLP预测接触力和尖端位移，并使用NSGA-II进行多目标优化。

Result: 优化设计能够平衡高力和精细操作的需求，提升软机器人夹持器的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为软Fin-Ray夹持器的设计提供了有效工具，适用于不同应用场景。

Abstract: Soft Fin-Ray grippers can perform delicate and careful manipulation, which
has caused notable attention in different fields. These grippers can handle
objects of various forms and sizes safely. The internal structure of the
Fin-Ray finger plays a significant role in its adaptability and grasping
performance. However, modeling the non-linear grasp force and deformation
behaviors for design purposes is challenging. Moreover, when the Fin-Ray finger
becomes more rigid and capable of exerting higher forces, it becomes less
delicate in handling objects. The contrast between these two objectives gives
rise to a multi-objective optimization problem. In this study, we employ finite
element method (FEM) to estimate the deflections and contact forces of the
Fin-Ray, grasping cylindrical objects. This dataset is then used to construct a
multilayer perception (MLP) for prediction of the contact force and the tip
displacement. The FEM dataset consists of three input and four target features.
The three input features of the MLP and optimization design variables are the
thickness of the front and supporting beams, the thickness of the cross beams,
and the equal spacing between the cross beams. In addition, the target features
are the maximum contact forces and maximum tip displacements in x- and
y-directions. The magnitude of maximum contact force and magnitude of maximum
tip displacement are the two objectives, showing the trade-off between force
and delicate manipulation in soft Fin-Ray grippers. Furthermore, the optimized
set of solutions are found using multi-objective optimal techniques. We use
non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) method for this purpose. Our
findings demonstrate that our methodologies can be used to improve the design
and gripping performance of soft robotic grippers, helping us to choose a
design not only for delicate grasping but also for high-force applications.

Conclusion: 集成扩散作为传统点估计轨迹规划的替代方案，可提升决策安全性，建模后验轨迹分布的不确定性。

Abstract: End-to-end planning systems for autonomous driving are improving rapidly,
especially in closed-loop simulation environments like CARLA. Many such driving
systems either do not consider uncertainty as part of the plan itself, or
obtain it by using specialized representations that do not generalize. In this
paper, we propose EnDfuser, an end-to-end driving system that uses a diffusion
model as the trajectory planner. EnDfuser effectively leverages complex
perception information like fused camera and LiDAR features, through combining
attention pooling and trajectory planning into a single diffusion transformer
module. Instead of committing to a single plan, EnDfuser produces a
distribution of candidate trajectories (128 for our case) from a single
perception frame through ensemble diffusion. By observing the full set of
candidate trajectories, EnDfuser provides interpretability for uncertain,
multi-modal future trajectory spaces, where there are multiple plausible
options. EnDfuser achieves a competitive driving score of 70.1 on the Longest6
benchmark in CARLA with minimal concessions on inference speed. Our findings
suggest that ensemble diffusion, used as a drop-in replacement for traditional
point-estimate trajectory planning modules, can help improve the safety of
driving decisions by modeling the uncertainty of the posterior trajectory
distribution.

Abstract: We introduce OG-VLA, a novel architecture and learning framework that
combines the generalization strengths of Vision Language Action models (VLAs)
with the robustness of 3D-aware policies. We address the challenge of mapping
natural language instructions and multi-view RGBD observations to quasi-static
robot actions. 3D-aware robot policies achieve state-of-the-art performance on
precise robot manipulation tasks, but struggle with generalization to unseen
instructions, scenes, and objects. On the other hand, VLAs excel at
generalizing across instructions and scenes, but can be sensitive to camera and
robot pose variations. We leverage prior knowledge embedded in language and
vision foundation models to improve generalization of 3D-aware keyframe
policies. OG-VLA projects input observations from diverse views into a point
cloud which is then rendered from canonical orthographic views, ensuring input
view invariance and consistency between input and output spaces. These
canonical views are processed with a vision backbone, a Large Language Model
(LLM), and an image diffusion model to generate images that encode the next
position and orientation of the end-effector on the input scene. Evaluations on
the Arnold and Colosseum benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art generalization
to unseen environments, with over 40% relative improvements while maintaining
robust performance in seen settings. We also show real-world adaption in 3 to 5
demonstrations along with strong generalization. Videos and resources at

Motivation: 由于真实世界测试成本高且手工模拟难以准确反映真实条件，论文旨在通过世界模型提供一种更高效的机器人策略评估方法。

Method: 训练动作条件视频生成模型作为世界模型，提出块自回归扩散变换器进行高效推理，并使用视觉语言模型作为奖励函数进行蒙特卡洛模拟。

Result: WPE在模拟机器人动作时表现良好，但对分布外动作的评估存在偏差，但仍能保持策略的相对排名。

Conclusion: 世界模型可作为机器人策略评估的起点，尽管在模拟复杂物体交互时仍有挑战。

Abstract: Robotics has broad applications from automating house chores to taking care
of patients. However, evaluating robot control policies is challenging, as
real-world testing is expensive, while handcrafted simulations often fail to
accurately reflect real-world conditions, resulting in poor correlation between
simulated evaluation and real-world outcomes. In this work, we investigate
World-model-based Policy Evaluation (WPE). We first train an action-conditioned
video generation model as a proxy to real-world environments. To enable
efficient rollouts of hundreds of interactive steps while mitigating error
accumulation in the world model, we propose an inference scheme which we call
Blockwise-Autoregressive Diffusion Transformer with adjustable context and
decoding horizon lengths. To ensure that the world model indeed follows action
input, we propose metrics based on the agreement between the ground truth video
and generated video conditioned on the same sequence of actions to evaluate the
world model. We then use the world model for policy evaluation by performing
Monte Carlo rollouts in the world model while employing a vision-language model
(VLM) as a reward function. Interestingly, we found that WPE tends to
underestimate the policy values for in-distribution actions and overestimate
policy values for out-of-distribution actions. Nevertheless, WPE preserves the
relative rankings of different policies. In emulating real robot executions,
WPE achieves high fidelity in mimicing robot arm movements as in real videos,
while emulating highly realistic object interaction remains challenging.
Despite this limitation, we show that a world model can serve as a starting
point for evaluating robot policies before real-world deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种稀疏想象的视觉世界模型规划方法，显著提高计算效率，同时保持高控制精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 世界模型在复杂环境中提升决策能力，但高计算资源需求限制了实时应用，尤其在机器人领域。

Method: 基于稀疏训练的视觉世界模型，采用随机分组注意力策略，动态调整处理的令牌数量。

Result: 实验表明，稀疏想象在保持任务性能的同时大幅提升推理效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为世界模型在实时决策场景中的应用提供了可行路径。

Abstract: World model based planning has significantly improved decision-making in
complex environments by enabling agents to simulate future states and make
informed choices. However, ensuring the prediction accuracy of world models
often demands substantial computational resources, posing a major challenge for
real-time applications. This computational burden is particularly restrictive
in robotics, where resources are severely constrained. To address this
limitation, we propose a Sparse Imagination for Efficient Visual World Model
Planning, which enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of
tokens processed during forward prediction. Our method leverages a sparsely
trained vision-based world model based on transformers with randomized grouped
attention strategy, allowing the model to adaptively adjust the number of
tokens processed based on the computational resource. By enabling sparse
imagination (rollout), our approach significantly accelerates planning while
maintaining high control fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that sparse
imagination preserves task performance while dramatically improving inference
efficiency, paving the way for the deployment of world models in real-time
decision-making scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出SEMNAV，一种利用语义分割作为视觉输入的方法，以提升视觉语义导航（VSN）的泛化能力，并在仿真和真实环境中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VSN模型依赖仿真环境的RGB数据，泛化能力受限，难以适应真实世界。

Method: 采用语义分割作为主要视觉输入，结合新数据集SEMNAV训练模型。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中表现优于现有方法，成功率高且能缓解仿真到现实的差距。

Conclusion: SEMNAV通过语义分割提升导航能力，是VSN领域的有前景解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Semantic Navigation (VSN) is a fundamental problem in robotics, where
an agent must navigate toward a target object in an unknown environment, mainly
using visual information. Most state-of-the-art VSN models are trained in
simulation environments, where rendered scenes of the real world are used, at
best. These approaches typically rely on raw RGB data from the virtual scenes,
which limits their ability to generalize to real-world environments due to
domain adaptation issues. To tackle this problem, in this work, we propose
SEMNAV, a novel approach that leverages semantic segmentation as the main
visual input representation of the environment to enhance the agent's
perception and decision-making capabilities. By explicitly incorporating
high-level semantic information, our model learns robust navigation policies
that improve generalization across unseen environments, both in simulated and
real world settings. We also introduce a newly curated dataset, i.e. the SEMNAV
dataset, designed for training semantic segmentation-aware navigation models
like SEMNAV. Our approach is evaluated extensively in both simulated
environments and with real-world robotic platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that SEMNAV outperforms existing state-of-the-art VSN models,
achieving higher success rates in the Habitat 2.0 simulation environment, using
the HM3D dataset. Furthermore, our real-world experiments highlight the
effectiveness of semantic segmentation in mitigating the sim-to-real gap,
making our model a promising solution for practical VSN-based robotic
applications. We release SEMNAV dataset, code and trained models at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动作表示和网络架构上存在固有局限，频域表示能更有效地捕捉动作的结构化特性（低频全局运动、高频局部细节），且不同任务需要不同频带的建模精度。

Method: 提出了一种渐进式建模分层频域组件的范式，并引入连续潜在表示以保持动作空间的平滑性和连续性。

Result: 在多种2D和3D机器人操作基准测试中，该方法在精度和效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 频域自回归框架结合连续潜在表示在通用机器人操作任务中展现出显著潜力。

Abstract: Learning effective visuomotor policies for robotic manipulation is
challenging, as it requires generating precise actions while maintaining
computational efficiency. Existing methods remain unsatisfactory due to
inherent limitations in the essential action representation and the basic
network architectures. We observe that representing actions in the frequency
domain captures the structured nature of motion more effectively: low-frequency
components reflect global movement patterns, while high-frequency components
encode fine local details. Additionally, robotic manipulation tasks of varying
complexity demand different levels of modeling precision across these frequency
bands. Motivated by this, we propose a novel paradigm for visuomotor policy
learning that progressively models hierarchical frequency components. To
further enhance precision, we introduce continuous latent representations that
maintain smoothness and continuity in the action space. Extensive experiments
across diverse 2D and 3D robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency,
showcasing the potential of a frequency-domain autoregressive framework with
continuous tokens for generalized robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: WoMAP通过创新的数据生成和奖励信号提取方法，显著提升了对象定位的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Language-instructed active object localization is a critical challenge for
robots, requiring efficient exploration of partially observable environments.
However, state-of-the-art approaches either struggle to generalize beyond
demonstration datasets (e.g., imitation learning methods) or fail to generate
physically grounded actions (e.g., VLMs). To address these limitations, we
introduce WoMAP (World Models for Active Perception): a recipe for training
open-vocabulary object localization policies that: (i) uses a Gaussian
Splatting-based real-to-sim-to-real pipeline for scalable data generation
without the need for expert demonstrations, (ii) distills dense rewards signals
from open-vocabulary object detectors, and (iii) leverages a latent world model
for dynamics and rewards prediction to ground high-level action proposals at
inference time. Rigorous simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate
WoMAP's superior performance in a broad range of zero-shot object localization
tasks, with more than 9x and 2x higher success rates compared to VLM and
diffusion policy baselines, respectively. Further, we show that WoMAP achieves
strong generalization and sim-to-real transfer on a TidyBot.

Abstract: We introduce DualMap, an online open-vocabulary mapping system that enables

frontend and object-level status check eliminate the costly 3D object merging

dual-map representation combines a global abstract map for high-level candidate

Motivation: 解决现有自动驾驶系统缺乏可解释性和安全性保证的问题，同时提升对动态驾驶场景的适应性。

Method: 整合对比视觉语言模型编码器、动态提示生成、分层安全模块和预测世界模型，构建统一的语义奖励框架。

Result: 在CARLA Town 2中实现19.4 km/h平均速度、98%路线完成率和接近零碰撞，零样本泛化到真实数据。

Conclusion: DriveMind展示了跨领域对齐的潜力，为实际部署提供了可行性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems map sensor data directly to control
commands, but remain opaque, lack interpretability, and offer no formal safety
guarantees. While recent vision-language-guided reinforcement learning (RL)
methods introduce semantic feedback, they often rely on static prompts and
fixed objectives, limiting adaptability to dynamic driving scenes. We present
DriveMind, a unified semantic reward framework that integrates: (i) a
contrastive Vision-Language Model (VLM) encoder for stepwise semantic
anchoring; (ii) a novelty-triggered VLM encoder-decoder, fine-tuned via
chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation, for dynamic prompt generation upon
semantic drift; (iii) a hierarchical safety module enforcing kinematic
constraints (e.g., speed, lane centering, stability); and (iv) a compact
predictive world model to reward alignment with anticipated ideal states.
DriveMind achieves 19.4 +/- 2.3 km/h average speed, 0.98 +/- 0.03 route
completion, and near-zero collisions in CARLA Town 2, outperforming baselines
by over 4% in success rate. Its semantic reward generalizes zero-shot to real
dash-cam data with minimal distributional shift, demonstrating robust
cross-domain alignment and potential for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: RoboMoRe是一个基于大语言模型（LLM）的框架，通过双阶段优化（粗优化和细优化）实现机器人形态和奖励函数的联合优化，显著优于人工设计和其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人协同设计（形态与控制策略联合优化）常因固定奖励函数导致次优设计，缺乏对不同形态的多样化运动模式的探索。

Method: RoboMoRe采用双阶段优化：粗优化阶段通过LLM生成多样且高质量的形态-奖励对；细优化阶段通过交替的LLM引导奖励和形态梯度更新迭代优化。

Result: 在八项任务中，RoboMoRe无需任务特定提示或预定义模板，显著优于人工设计和其他方法。

Conclusion: RoboMoRe通过LLM驱动的奖励和形态优化，成功实现了高效机器人形态及其适配运动行为的协同设计。

Abstract: Robot co-design, jointly optimizing morphology and control policy, remains a
longstanding challenge in the robotics community, where many promising robots
have been developed. However, a key limitation lies in its tendency to converge
to sub-optimal designs due to the use of fixed reward functions, which fail to
explore the diverse motion modes suitable for different morphologies. Here we
propose RoboMoRe, a large language model (LLM)-driven framework that integrates
morphology and reward shaping for co-optimization within the robot co-design
loop. RoboMoRe performs a dual-stage optimization: in the coarse optimization
stage, an LLM-based diversity reflection mechanism generates both diverse and
high-quality morphology-reward pairs and efficiently explores their
distribution. In the fine optimization stage, top candidates are iteratively
refined through alternating LLM-guided reward and morphology gradient updates.
RoboMoRe can optimize both efficient robot morphologies and their suited motion
behaviors through reward shaping. Results demonstrate that without any
task-specific prompting or predefined reward/morphology templates, RoboMoRe
significantly outperforms human-engineered designs and competing methods across
eight different tasks.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have the potential to perform complex tasks in human centered

Masked Transformers and FlowMatching on 100 hours of humanoid demonstrations.
Additionally we explore architectural variants with different attention

Motivation: 多智能体强化学习（MARL）在复杂任务中有效，但样本效率低且需要手动调整奖励函数。LLM在单机器人任务中表现良好，但在多机器人系统中应用较少。

Method: LAMARL包含两个模块：1）利用LLM自动生成先验策略和奖励函数；2）使用MARL基于生成的函数训练机器人策略。

Result: 在形状组装任务中，LAMARL显著提升了样本效率（平均185.9%）和任务完成率，LLM输出成功率提高了28.5%-67.5%。

Conclusion: LAMARL展示了LLM与MARL结合的潜力，为多机器人系统提供了高效且自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: Although Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is effective for complex
multi-robot tasks, it suffers from low sample efficiency and requires iterative
manual reward tuning. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in
single-robot settings, but their application in multi-robot systems remains
largely unexplored. This paper introduces a novel LLM-Aided MARL (LAMARL)
approach, which integrates MARL with LLMs, significantly enhancing sample
efficiency without requiring manual design. LAMARL consists of two modules: the
first module leverages LLMs to fully automate the generation of prior policy
and reward functions. The second module is MARL, which uses the generated
functions to guide robot policy training effectively. On a shape assembly
benchmark, both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the unique
advantages of LAMARL. Ablation studies show that the prior policy improves
sample efficiency by an average of 185.9% and enhances task completion, while
structured prompts based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and basic APIs improve LLM
output success rates by 28.5%-67.5%. Videos and code are available at

Abstract: Controlling fine-grained forces during manipulation remains a core challenge
in robotics. While robot policies learned from robot-collected data or
simulation show promise, they struggle to generalize across the diverse range
of real-world interactions. Learning directly from humans offers a scalable
solution, enabling demonstrators to perform skills in their natural embodiment
and in everyday environments. However, visual demonstrations alone lack the
information needed to infer precise contact forces. We present FeelTheForce
(FTF): a robot learning system that models human tactile behavior to learn
force-sensitive manipulation. Using a tactile glove to measure contact forces
and a vision-based model to estimate hand pose, we train a closed-loop policy
that continuously predicts the forces needed for manipulation. This policy is
re-targeted to a Franka Panda robot with tactile gripper sensors using shared
visual and action representations. At execution, a PD controller modulates
gripper closure to track predicted forces-enabling precise, force-aware
control. Our approach grounds robust low-level force control in scalable human
supervision, achieving a 77% success rate across 5 force-sensitive manipulation
tasks. Code and videos are available at https://feel-the-force-ftf.github.io.

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) is a powerful technique for imaging
surfaces with atomic resolution, providing insight into physical and chemical
processes at the level of single atoms and molecules. A regular task of STM
image analysis is the identification and labelling of features of interest
against a uniform background. Performing this manually is a labour-intensive
task, requiring significant human effort. To reduce this burden, we propose an
automated approach to the segmentation of STM images that uses both few-shot
learning and unsupervised learning. Our technique offers greater flexibility
compared to previous supervised methods; it removes the requirement for large
manually annotated datasets and is thus easier to adapt to an unseen surface
while still maintaining a high accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach by using it to recognise atomic features on three distinct
surfaces: Si(001), Ge(001), and TiO$_2$(110), including adsorbed AsH$_3$
molecules on the silicon and germanium surfaces. Our model exhibits strong
generalisation capabilities, and following initial training, can be adapted to
unseen surfaces with as few as one additional labelled data point. This work is
a significant step towards efficient and material-agnostic, automatic
segmentation of STM images.

Motivation: 探讨在策略学习中，代理仅通过噪声信号了解评分规则时，公平性如何受到影响，尤其是不同成本群体的差异。

Method: 比较两种代理模型（天真代理和贝叶斯代理）在不同透明度下的行为，分析效用差异。

Result: 天真代理的效用差异随噪声无限增长，而贝叶斯代理的差异有限；透明度非单调影响差异，中间透明度常最小化差异。

Conclusion: 透明度水平对公平性有复杂影响，中间透明度可能最优；群体间成本与先验信念的不对称性需进一步研究。

Abstract: We study how partial information about scoring rules affects fairness in
strategic learning settings. In strategic learning, a learner deploys a scoring
rule, and agents respond strategically by modifying their features -- at some
cost -- to improve their outcomes. However, in our work, agents do not observe
the scoring rule directly; instead, they receive a noisy signal of said rule.
We consider two different agent models: (i) naive agents, who take the noisy
signal at face value, and (ii) Bayesian agents, who update a prior belief based
on the signal.
  Our goal is to understand how disparities in outcomes arise between groups
that differ in their costs of feature modification, and how these disparities
vary with the level of transparency of the learner's rule. For naive agents, we
show that utility disparities can grow unboundedly with noise, and that the
group with lower costs can, perhaps counter-intuitively, be disproportionately
harmed under limited transparency. In contrast, for Bayesian agents,
disparities remain bounded. We provide a full characterization of disparities
across groups as a function of the level of transparency and show that they can
vary non-monotonically with noise; in particular, disparities are often
minimized at intermediate levels of transparency. Finally, we extend our
analysis to settings where groups differ not only in cost, but also in prior
beliefs, and study how this asymmetry influences fairness.

Abstract: Since the advent of AI, games have served as progress benchmarks. Meanwhile,
imperfect-information variants of chess have existed for over a century,
present extreme challenges, and have been the focus of significant AI research.
Beyond calculation needed in regular chess, they require reasoning about
information gathering, the opponent's knowledge, signaling, etc. The most
popular variant, Fog of War (FoW) chess (aka. dark chess) is a recognized
challenge problem in AI after superhuman performance was reached in no-limit
Texas hold'em poker. We present Obscuro, the first superhuman AI for FoW chess.
It introduces advances to search in imperfect-information games, enabling
strong, scalable reasoning. Experiments against the prior state-of-the-art AI
and human players -- including the world's best -- show that Obscuro is
significantly stronger. FoW chess is the largest (by amount of imperfect
information) turn-based game in which superhuman performance has been achieved
and the largest game in which imperfect-information search has been
successfully applied.

Result: 在连续追逃和仓库拾取场景中，该方法表现出主动信息收集能力，并优于被动策略。

Conclusion: 该方法为连续POSG中的在线规划提供了有效解决方案，适用于多玩家和复杂环境。

Abstract: Game-theoretic agents must make plans that optimally gather information about
their opponents. These problems are modeled by partially observable stochastic
games (POSGs), but planning in fully continuous POSGs is intractable without
heavy offline computation or assumptions on the order of belief maintained by
each player. We formulate a finite history/horizon refinement of POSGs which
admits competitive information gathering behavior in trajectory space, and
through a series of approximations, we present an online method for computing
rational trajectory plans in these games which leverages particle-based
estimations of the joint state space and performs stochastic gradient play. We
also provide the necessary adjustments required to deploy this method on
individual agents. The method is tested in continuous pursuit-evasion and
warehouse-pickup scenarios (alongside extensions to $N > 2$ players and to more
complex environments with visual and physical obstacles), demonstrating
evidence of active information gathering and outperforming passive competitors.

Result: 提供了一种可重复、可移植且成本高效的解决方案，可作为商业PaaS的替代或补充。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂数据网格环境中支持互操作性，尤其适用于混合现代和传统基础设施的场景。

Abstract: Many large enterprises that operate highly governed and complex ICT
environments have no efficient and effective way to support their Data and AI
teams in rapidly spinning up and tearing down self-service data and compute
infrastructure, to experiment with new data analytic tools, and deploy data
products into operational use. This paper proposes a key piece of the solution
to the overall problem, in the form of an on-demand self-service data-platform
infrastructure to empower de-centralised data teams to build data products on
top of centralised templates, policies and governance. The core innovation is
an efficient method to leverage immutable container operating systems and
infrastructure-as-code methodologies for creating, from scratch, vendor-neutral
and short-lived Kubernetes clusters on-premises and in any cloud environment.
Our proposed approach can serve as a repeatable, portable and cost-efficient
alternative or complement to commercial Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings,
and this is particularly important in supporting interoperability in complex
data mesh environments with a mix of modern and legacy compute infrastructure.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种加速Transducer模型束搜索的通用方法，包括ALSD++和AES++两种优化算法，显著缩小了束搜索与贪心解码的速度差距，并提升了识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transducer模型的束搜索因重复评估关键网络组件而速度较慢，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用批量操作、树状假设结构、新颖的空白评分增强浅层融合，以及CUDA图执行优化GPU推理。

Result: 束搜索与贪心解码的速度差距缩小至10-20%，词错误率相对贪心解码提升14-30%，低资源浅层融合提升达11%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了Transducer模型的束搜索效率与性能，所有算法已开源。

Abstract: Transducer models have emerged as a promising choice for end-to-end ASR
systems, offering a balanced trade-off between recognition accuracy, streaming
capabilities, and inference speed in greedy decoding. However, beam search
significantly slows down Transducers due to repeated evaluations of key network
components, limiting practical applications. This paper introduces a universal
method to accelerate beam search for Transducers, enabling the implementation
of two optimized algorithms: ALSD++ and AES++. The proposed method utilizes
batch operations, a tree-based hypothesis structure, novel blank scoring for
enhanced shallow fusion, and CUDA graph execution for efficient GPU inference.
This narrows the speed gap between beam and greedy modes to only 10-20% for the
whole system, achieves 14-30% relative improvement in WER compared to greedy
decoding, and improves shallow fusion for low-resource up to 11% compared to
existing implementations. All the algorithms are open sourced.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种使用神经网络集成技术为强制对齐边界生成置信区间的方法，相比单一模型略有改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强制对齐工具通常仅提供单一边界估计，缺乏对边界不确定性的量化。

Method: 训练十个不同的分段分类神经网络，通过集成方法确定边界中位数并构建97.85%置信区间。

Result: 在Buckeye和TIMIT语料库上，集成边界比单一模型略有提升。

Conclusion: 该方法成功量化了边界不确定性，并提供了可集成到Praat TextGrids中的置信区间输出。

Abstract: Forced alignment is a common tool to align audio with orthographic and
phonetic transcriptions. Most forced alignment tools provide only a single
estimate of a boundary. The present project introduces a method of deriving
confidence intervals for these boundaries using a neural network ensemble
technique. Ten different segment classifier neural networks were previously
trained, and the alignment process is repeated with each model. The alignment
ensemble is then used to place the boundary at the median of the boundaries in
the ensemble, and 97.85% confidence intervals are constructed using order
statistics. On the Buckeye and TIMIT corpora, the ensemble boundaries show a
slight improvement over using just a single model. The confidence intervals are
incorporated into Praat TextGrids using a point tier, and they are also output
as a table for researchers to analyze separately as diagnostics or to
incorporate uncertainty into their analyses.

TL;DR: LinearVC是一种简单的语音转换方法，通过线性变换自监督特征实现高效语音转换，并揭示了特征空间的结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自监督表示的结构，探索语音转换中内容与说话者信息的分离方法。

Method: 使用线性变换和旋转特征空间的方法，并通过奇异值分解显式分解内容与说话者信息。

Result: 仅需100维的线性投影即可实现高质量的语音转换。

Conclusion: LinearVC不仅为语音转换提供了实用方法，还深化了对自监督语音表示的理解。

Abstract: We introduce LinearVC, a simple voice conversion method that sheds light on
the structure of self-supervised representations. First, we show that simple
linear transformations of self-supervised features effectively convert voices.
Next, we probe the geometry of the feature space by constraining the set of
allowed transformations. We find that just rotating the features is sufficient
for high-quality voice conversion. This suggests that content information is
embedded in a low-dimensional subspace which can be linearly transformed to
produce a target voice. To validate this hypothesis, we finally propose a
method that explicitly factorizes content and speaker information using
singular value decomposition; the resulting linear projection with a rank of
just 100 gives competitive conversion results. Our work has implications for
both practical voice conversion and a broader understanding of self-supervised
speech representations. Samples and code: https://www.kamperh.com/linearvc/.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构音障碍语音的高说话者间变异性和慢语速导致ASR系统性能下降，需改进识别效果。

Method: 扩展了Rhythm and Voice（RnV）转换框架，引入音节节奏建模方法，并评估其对ASR性能的影响。

Result: 实验表明，LF-MMI模型在转换后的语音上显著降低了词错误率，而Whisper微调效果有限。

Conclusion: 无监督节奏和语音转换在构音障碍ASR中具有潜力。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with dysarthric speech
due to high inter-speaker variability and slow speaking rates. To address this,
we explore dysarthric-to-healthy speech conversion for improved ASR
performance. Our approach extends the Rhythm and Voice (RnV) conversion
framework by introducing a syllable-based rhythm modeling method suited for
dysarthric speech. We assess its impact on ASR by training LF-MMI models and
fine-tuning Whisper on converted speech. Experiments on the Torgo corpus reveal
that LF-MMI achieves significant word error rate reductions, especially for
more severe cases of dysarthria, while fine-tuning Whisper on converted data
has minimal effect on its performance. These results highlight the potential of
unsupervised rhythm and voice conversion for dysarthric ASR. Code available at:

Conclusion: 神经网络和自编码器在端到端通信系统中具有潜力，特别是在高阶调制和动态信噪比环境下表现优异。

Abstract: Neural network (NN)-based end-to-end (E2E) communication systems, in which
each system component may consist of a portion of a neural network, have been
investigated as potential tools for developing artificial intelligence
(Al)-native E2E systems. In this paper, we propose an NN-based bitwise receiver
that improves computational efficiency while maintaining performance comparable
to baseline demappers. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel
symbol-wise autoencoder (AE)-based E2E system that jointly optimizes the
transmitter and receiver at the physical layer. We evaluate the proposed
NN-based receiver using bit-error rate (BER) analysis to confirm that the
numerical BER achieved by NN-based receivers or transceivers is accurate.
Results demonstrate that the AE-based system outperforms baseline
architectures, particularly for higher-order modulation schemes. We further
show that the training signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) significantly affects the
performance of the systems when inference is conducted at different SNR levels.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于注意力机制的MMSE（A-MMSE）方法，通过Transformer学习最优MMSE滤波器，降低计算复杂度并提升信道估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MMSE方法需要难以获取的二阶统计信息，而现有深度学习方法复杂度高，因此需要一种高效且低复杂度的信道估计方法。

Method: 提出A-MMSE框架，利用注意力Transformer学习最优MMSE滤波器，采用两阶段注意力编码器捕捉信道相关性，并支持秩自适应扩展以平衡复杂度与性能。

Result: 在3GPP TDL信道模型下，A-MMSE在多种SNR条件下均优于基线方法，归一化MSE表现优异。

Conclusion: A-MMSE及其秩自适应扩展在性能与复杂度之间实现了新的平衡，为实际信道估计方法设定了新标准。

Abstract: In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), accurate channel
estimation is crucial. Classical signal processing based approaches, such as
minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation, often require second-order
statistics that are difficult to obtain in practice. Recent deep neural
networks based methods have been introduced to address this; yet they often
suffer from high complexity. This paper proposes an Attention-aided MMSE
(A-MMSE), a novel model-based DNN framework that learns the optimal MMSE filter
via the Attention Transformer. Once trained, the A-MMSE estimates the channel
through a single linear operation for channel estimation, eliminating nonlinear
activations during inference and thus reducing computational complexity. To
enhance the learning efficiency of the A-MMSE, we develop a two-stage Attention
encoder, designed to effectively capture the channel correlation structure.
Additionally, a rank-adaptive extension of the proposed A-MMSE allows flexible
trade-offs between complexity and channel estimation accuracy. Extensive
simulations with 3GPP TDL channel models demonstrate that the proposed A-MMSE
consistently outperforms other baseline methods in terms of normalized MSE
across a wide range of SNR conditions. In particular, the A-MMSE and its
rank-adaptive extension establish a new frontier in the performance complexity
trade-off, redefining the standard for practical channel estimation methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DT-CORL是一种离线强化学习框架，通过基于Transformer的信念预测器处理延迟动态，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线强化学习在部署时因延迟和动态环境导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 使用Transformer-based信念预测器生成延迟鲁棒动作，无需在训练中观察延迟数据。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，DT-CORL优于历史增强和传统信念方法。

Conclusion: DT-CORL有效缩小了模拟与现实的延迟差距，同时保持了数据效率。

Abstract: Offline-to-online deployment of reinforcement-learning (RL) agents must
bridge two gaps: (1) the sim-to-real gap, where real systems add latency and
other imperfections not present in simulation, and (2) the interaction gap,
where policies trained purely offline face out-of-distribution states during
online execution because gathering new interaction data is costly or risky.
Agents therefore have to generalize from static, delay-free datasets to
dynamic, delay-prone environments. Standard offline RL learns from delay-free
logs yet must act under delays that break the Markov assumption and hurt
performance. We introduce DT-CORL (Delay-Transformer belief policy Constrained
Offline RL), an offline-RL framework built to cope with delayed dynamics at
deployment. DT-CORL (i) produces delay-robust actions with a transformer-based
belief predictor even though it never sees delayed observations during
training, and (ii) is markedly more sample-efficient than na\"ive
history-augmentation baselines. Experiments on D4RL benchmarks with several
delay settings show that DT-CORL consistently outperforms both
history-augmentation and vanilla belief-based methods, narrowing the
sim-to-real latency gap while preserving data efficiency.

*Kundan Krishna,Joseph Y Cheng,Charles Maalouf,Leon A Gatys*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DSA框架通过解耦安全计算与任务优化模型，提升AI安全性的同时保持高效性和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI安全方法（如护栏模型和对齐训练）常牺牲推理效率或开发灵活性，DSA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DSA利用轻量级适配器，基于基础模型的内部表示实现多样化的安全功能，对推理成本影响极小。

Result: DSA在幻觉检测、仇恨言论分类及不安全输入/响应识别上表现优异，同时支持动态调整对齐强度。

Conclusion: DSA为模块化、高效且适应性强的AI安全与对齐提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Existing paradigms for ensuring AI safety, such as guardrail models and
alignment training, often compromise either inference efficiency or development
flexibility. We introduce Disentangled Safety Adapters (DSA), a novel framework
addressing these challenges by decoupling safety-specific computations from a
task-optimized base model. DSA utilizes lightweight adapters that leverage the
base model's internal representations, enabling diverse and flexible safety
functionalities with minimal impact on inference cost. Empirically, DSA-based
safety guardrails substantially outperform comparably sized standalone models,
notably improving hallucination detection (0.88 vs. 0.61 AUC on Summedits) and
also excelling at classifying hate speech (0.98 vs. 0.92 on ToxiGen) and unsafe
model inputs and responses (0.93 vs. 0.90 on AEGIS2.0 & BeaverTails).
Furthermore, DSA-based safety alignment allows dynamic, inference-time
adjustment of alignment strength and a fine-grained trade-off between
instruction following performance and model safety. Importantly, combining the
DSA safety guardrail with DSA safety alignment facilitates context-dependent
alignment strength, boosting safety on StrongReject by 93% while maintaining
98% performance on MTBench -- a total reduction in alignment tax of 8
percentage points compared to standard safety alignment fine-tuning. Overall,
DSA presents a promising path towards more modular, efficient, and adaptable AI
safety and alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI开发流程包含多个训练阶段，但缺乏明确的责任归属机制，难以确定模型成功或失败的具体原因。

Method: 提出基于一阶近似的估计器，无需重新训练即可量化各训练阶段的影响，同时考虑训练数据和优化动态。

Result: 实证表明，该方法能有效识别对特定行为负责的训练阶段，为模型分析提供实用工具。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI开发提供了更明确的责任追溯机制，推动了更负责任的AI发展。

Abstract: Modern AI development pipelines often involve multiple stages-pretraining,
fine-tuning rounds, and subsequent adaptation or alignment-with numerous model
update steps within each stage. This raises a critical question of
accountability: when a deployed model succeeds or fails, which stage is
responsible, and to what extent? We pose the problem of accountability
attribution, which aims to trace model behavior back to specific stages of the
training process. To address this, we propose a general framework that answers
counterfactual questions about stage effects: how would the model behavior have
changed if the updates from a training stage had not been executed?. Within
this framework, we introduce estimators based on first-order approximations
that efficiently quantify the stage effects without retraining. Our estimators
account for both the training data and key aspects of optimization dynamics,
including learning rate schedules, momentum, and weight decay. Empirically, we
demonstrate that our approach identifies training stages accountable for
specific behaviors, offering a practical tool for model analysis and a step
toward more accountable AI development.

Motivation: MOFs的设计空间巨大且复杂，传统计算方法计算成本高，机器学习提供了一种高效替代方案。

Method: 开发了一个三部分框架：生成GPT模型、Transformer属性预测器（MOFormer）和强化学习模块，通过MOFid编码实现。

Result: 该方法能够生成具有特定功能属性的可合成且拓扑有效的MOFs。

Conclusion: 展示了大型语言模型与强化学习结合在MOFs逆向设计中的潜力，为计算材料发现开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The discovery of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) with application-specific
properties remains a central challenge in materials chemistry, owing to the
immense size and complexity of their structural design space. Conventional
computational screening techniques such as molecular simulations and density
functional theory (DFT), while accurate, are computationally prohibitive at
scale. Machine learning offers an exciting alternative by leveraging
data-driven approaches to accelerate materials discovery. The complexity of
MOFs, with their extended periodic structures and diverse topologies, creates
both opportunities and challenges for generative modeling approaches. To
address these challenges, we present a reinforcement learning-enhanced,
transformer-based framework for the de novo design of MOFs. Central to our
approach is MOFid, a chemically-informed string representation encoding both
connectivity and topology, enabling scalable generative modeling. Our pipeline
comprises three components: (1) a generative GPT model trained on MOFid
sequences, (2) MOFormer, a transformer-based property predictor, and (3) a
reinforcement learning (RL) module that optimizes generated candidates via
property-guided reward functions. By integrating property feedback into
sequence generation, our method drives the model toward synthesizable,
topologically valid MOFs with desired functional attributes. This work
demonstrates the potential of large language models, when coupled with
reinforcement learning, to accelerate inverse design in reticular chemistry and
unlock new frontiers in computational MOF discovery.

*Babak Barazandeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Localized LoRA提出了一种参数高效微调方法，通过局部低秩更新提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法（如LoRA）依赖全局低秩结构，可能忽略参数空间中的空间模式。

Method: 提出Localized LoRA框架，将权重更新建模为低秩矩阵的组合，应用于权重矩阵的结构化块中。

Result: 在匹配参数预算下，Localized LoRA的近似误差更低，实验表明其表达能力和适应性更强。

Conclusion: Localized LoRA是一种更高效且性能更好的微调方法。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, offer compact
and effective alternatives to full model fine-tuning by introducing low-rank
updates to pretrained weights. However, most existing approaches rely on global
low-rank structures, which can overlook spatial patterns spread across the
parameter space. In this work, we propose Localized LoRA, a generalized
framework that models weight updates as a composition of low-rank matrices
applied to structured blocks of the weight matrix. This formulation enables
dense, localized updates throughout the parameter space-without increasing the
total number of trainable parameters. We provide a formal comparison between
global, diagonal-local, and fully localized low-rank approximations, and show
that our method consistently achieves lower approximation error under matched
parameter budgets. Experiments on both synthetic and practical settings
demonstrate that Localized LoRA offers a more expressive and adaptable
alternative to existing methods, enabling efficient fine-tuning with improved
performance.

Motivation: 研究在风险敏感环境下学习MDP最优解的理论复杂性，填补现有理论空白。

Method: 提出模型基于风险敏感的Q值迭代方法（MB-RS-QVI），分析其收敛性和样本复杂度。

Result: 证明了学习Q值和策略的PAC界对有效视界和风险参数有指数依赖，且下界表明这种依赖不可避免。

Conclusion: MB-RS-QVI的PAC界在ε和δ上是紧致的，且在动作数量上接近紧致，为风险敏感RL提供了理论支持。

Abstract: In this paper we analyze the sample complexities of learning the optimal
state-action value function $Q^*$ and an optimal policy $\pi^*$ in a discounted
Markov decision process (MDP) where the agent has recursive entropic
risk-preferences with risk-parameter $\beta\neq 0$ and where a generative model
of the MDP is available. We provide and analyze a simple model based approach
which we call model-based risk-sensitive $Q$-value-iteration (MB-RS-QVI) which
leads to $(\epsilon,\delta)$-PAC-bounds on $\|Q^*-Q^k\|$, and
$\|V^*-V^{\pi_k}\|$ where $Q_k$ is the output of MB-RS-QVI after k iterations
and $\pi_k$ is the greedy policy with respect to $Q_k$. Both PAC-bounds have
exponential dependence on the effective horizon $\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$ and the
strength of this dependence grows with the learners risk-sensitivity $|\beta|$.
We also provide two lower bounds which shows that exponential dependence on
$|\beta|\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$ is unavoidable in both cases. The lower bounds
reveal that the PAC-bounds are both tight in $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ and
that the PAC-bound on $Q$-learning is tight in the number of actions $A$, and
that the PAC-bound on policy-learning is nearly tight in $A$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有蛋白质序列设计方法虽然表现良好，但其训练目标是序列恢复，无法保证设计性（即序列能否折叠成目标结构）。

Method: 采用Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)和Residue-level Designability Preference Optimization (ResiDPO)，利用AlphaFold pLDDT分数作为偏好信号，并在残基级别优化设计性。

Result: 通过ResiDPO优化的EnhancedMPNN在酶设计基准测试中，设计成功率从6.56%提升至17.57%。

Conclusion: 新方法通过优化设计性目标，显著提升了蛋白质序列设计的成功率，为蛋白质设计提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Protein sequence design methods have demonstrated strong performance in
sequence generation for de novo protein design. However, as the training
objective was sequence recovery, it does not guarantee designability--the
likelihood that a designed sequence folds into the desired structure. To bridge
this gap, we redefine the training objective by steering sequence generation
toward high designability. To do this, we integrate Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), using AlphaFold pLDDT scores as the preference signal,
which significantly improves the in silico design success rate. To further
refine sequence generation at a finer, residue-level granularity, we introduce
Residue-level Designability Preference Optimization (ResiDPO), which applies
residue-level structural rewards and decouples optimization across residues.
This enables direct improvement in designability while preserving regions that
already perform well. Using a curated dataset with residue-level annotations,
we fine-tune LigandMPNN with ResiDPO to obtain EnhancedMPNN, which achieves a
nearly 3-fold increase in in silico design success rate (from 6.56% to 17.57%)
on a challenging enzyme design benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs在视频生成中计算成本高，静态缓存无法适应生成动态，导致速度与质量的次优权衡。

Method: 提出Foresight技术，动态识别并重用DiT块输出，适应生成参数以优化效率。

Result: 在OpenSora、Latte和CogVideoX上实现最高1.63倍端到端加速，同时保持视频质量。

Conclusion: Foresight有效提升DiTs在视频生成中的计算效率，且开源代码可用。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art results in
text-to-image, text-to-video generation, and editing. However, their large
model size and the quadratic cost of spatial-temporal attention over multiple
denoising steps make video generation computationally expensive. Static caching
mitigates this by reusing features across fixed steps but fails to adapt to
generation dynamics, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between speed and
quality.
  We propose Foresight, an adaptive layer-reuse technique that reduces
computational redundancy across denoising steps while preserving baseline
performance. Foresight dynamically identifies and reuses DiT block outputs for
all layers across steps, adapting to generation parameters such as resolution
and denoising schedules to optimize efficiency. Applied to OpenSora, Latte, and
CogVideoX, Foresight achieves up to 1.63x end-to-end speedup, while maintaining
video quality. The source code of Foresight is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ADB的框架，通过引入受控的统计多样性来优化模型的分布外泛化能力，发现更高的分布内偏差反而能提升泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统验证范式通常关注最小化验证误差，但论文发现更高的分布内偏差可能带来更好的分布外泛化能力，挑战了常规做法。

Method: 提出Adaptive Distribution Bridge (ADB)框架，在训练中引入受控的统计多样性，使模型能够形成有效的偏差配置。

Result: 实验表明，ADB显著提升了分布外泛化能力，平均误差降低高达26.8%，且训练策略的百分位排名常超过74.4%。

Conclusion: ADB不仅提供了一种提升泛化能力的实用方法，还为重新思考偏差在鲁棒机器学习中的作用提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Machine learning models often degrade when deployed on data distributions
different from their training data. Challenging conventional validation
paradigms, we demonstrate that higher in-distribution (ID) bias can lead to
better out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Our Adaptive Distribution
Bridge (ADB) framework implements this insight by introducing controlled
statistical diversity during training, enabling models to develop bias profiles
that effectively generalize across distributions. Empirically, we observe a
robust negative correlation where higher ID bias corresponds to lower OOD
error--a finding that contradicts standard practices focused on minimizing
validation error. Evaluation on multiple datasets shows our approach
significantly improves OOD generalization. ADB achieves robust mean error
reductions of up to 26.8% compared to traditional cross-validation, and
consistently identifies high-performing training strategies, evidenced by
percentile ranks often exceeding 74.4%. Our work provides both a practical
method for improving generalization and a theoretical framework for
reconsidering the role of bias in robust machine learning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MTAD-RD的时空相关性检测模型，用于解决WSN异常检测中的特征提取不足、样本标签缺失、样本不平衡等问题，实验表明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSN异常检测面临时空特征提取不足、样本标签缺失、异常样本少及样本分布不平衡等挑战，需要一种更有效的模型来解决这些问题。

Method: MTAD-RD模型结合了RetNet增强的CR模块、多粒度特征融合模块和图注意力网络模块，采用两阶段训练策略，包括对比学习代理任务和缓存采样器联合训练。

Result: 在真实公共数据集上，MTAD-RD的F1分数达到90.97%，优于现有监督方法。

Conclusion: MTAD-RD通过创新的模型结构和训练策略，有效解决了WSN异常检测中的关键问题，并取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in the data collected by WSNs can provide crucial
evidence for assessing the reliability and stability of WSNs. Existing methods
for WSN anomaly detection often face challenges such as the limited extraction
of spatiotemporal correlation features, the absence of sample labels, few
anomaly samples, and an imbalanced sample distribution. To address these
issues, a spatiotemporal correlation detection model (MTAD-RD) considering both
model architecture and a two-stage training strategy perspective is proposed.
In terms of model structure design, the proposed MTAD-RD backbone network
includes a retentive network (RetNet) enhanced by a cross-retention (CR)
module, a multigranular feature fusion module, and a graph attention network
module to extract internode correlation information. This proposed model can
integrate the intermodal correlation features and spatial features of WSN
neighbor nodes while extracting global information from time series data.
Moreover, its serialized inference characteristic can remarkably reduce
inference overhead. For model training, a two-stage training approach was
designed. First, a contrastive learning proxy task was designed for time series
data with graph structure information in WSNs, enabling the backbone network to
learn transferable features from unlabeled data using unsupervised contrastive
learning methods, thereby addressing the issue of missing sample labels in the
dataset. Then, a caching-based sample sampler was designed to divide samples
into few-shot and contrastive learning data. A specific joint loss function was
developed to jointly train the dual-graph discriminator network to address the
problem of sample imbalance effectively. In experiments carried out on real
public datasets, the designed MTAD-RD anomaly detection method achieved an F1
score of 90.97%, outperforming existing supervised WSN anomaly detection
methods.

TL;DR: COGNATE框架利用通用硬件（如CPU）的廉价数据样本训练成本模型，并通过少量样本微调新兴硬件，显著减少数据需求，提升稀疏张量程序性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏张量程序在深度学习和图分析中至关重要，但针对早期硬件加速器的优化面临输入敏感性和模拟器成本高的挑战。

Method: COGNATE通过通用硬件数据训练成本模型，并少量微调新兴硬件，利用输入特征的跨平台同质性。

Result: COGNATE性能优于现有技术，SpMM和SDDMM平均加速分别达1.47x和1.39x。

Conclusion: COGNATE为稀疏张量程序的硬件加速优化提供了一种高效且数据需求低的解决方案。

Abstract: Sparse tensor programs are essential in deep learning and graph analytics,
driving the need for optimized processing. To meet this demand, specialized
hardware accelerators are being developed. Optimizing these programs for
accelerators is challenging for two reasons: program performance is highly
sensitive to variations in sparse inputs, and early-stage accelerators rely on
expensive simulators. Therefore, ML-based cost models used for optimizing such
programs on general-purpose hardware are often ineffective for early-stage
accelerators, as they require large datasets for proper training. To this end,
we introduce COGNATE, a novel framework that leverages inexpensive data samples
from general-purpose hardware (e.g., CPUs) to train cost models, followed by
few-shot fine-tuning on emerging hardware. COGNATE exploits the homogeneity of
input features across hardware platforms while effectively mitigating
heterogeneity, enabling cost model training with just 5% of the data samples
needed by accelerator-specific models to achieve comparable performance. We
conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that COGNATE outperforms existing
techniques, achieving average speedups of 1.47x (up to 5.46x) for SpMM and
1.39x (up to 4.22x) for SDDMM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为通道归一化（CN）的方法，用于增强时间序列建模中的通道可辨识性（CID），并通过自适应CN（ACN）和原型CN（PCN）进一步扩展其功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在时间序列建模中，缺乏通道可辨识性会导致模型忽略通道特异性，产生相同输入相同输出的问题。

Method: 提出通道归一化（CN），为每个通道分配独特的仿射变换参数；扩展为自适应CN（ACN）和原型CN（PCN）。

Result: 实验表明，CN及其变体显著提升了非CID和CID模型的性能。

Conclusion: CN及其扩展方法有效增强了通道可辨识性，并从信息论角度分析了其成功原因。

Abstract: Channel identifiability (CID) refers to the ability to distinguish between
individual channels in time series (TS) modeling. The absence of CID often
results in producing identical outputs for identical inputs, disregarding
channel-specific characteristics. In this paper, we highlight the importance of
CID and propose Channel Normalization (CN), a simple yet effective
normalization strategy that enhances CID by assigning distinct affine
transformation parameters to each channel. We further extend CN in two ways: 1)
Adaptive CN (ACN) dynamically adjusts parameters based on the input TS,
improving adaptability in TS models, and 2) Prototypical CN (PCN) introduces a
set of learnable prototypes instead of per-channel parameters, enabling
applicability to datasets with unknown or varying number of channels and
facilitating use in TS foundation models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CN and its variants by applying them to various TS models, achieving
significant performance gains for both non-CID and CID models. In addition, we
analyze the success of our approach from an information theory perspective.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于正样本和无标签数据（PU学习）的目标营销方法，通过识别对产品感兴趣但缺乏公司忠诚度的潜在客户，实现高效营销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公司希望通过营销吸引对产品感兴趣但缺乏忠诚度的客户，以提升营销效率。

Method: 采用双PU学习方法，通过单阶段优化训练分类器，识别潜在客户。

Result: 数值实验验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 双PU学习方法能有效识别目标客户，提升营销效率。

Abstract: In this study, we propose a method for identifying potential customers in
targeted marketing by applying learning from positive and unlabeled data (PU
learning). We consider a scenario in which a company sells a product and can
observe only the customers who purchased it. Decision-makers seek to market
products effectively based on whether people have loyalty to the company.
Individuals with loyalty are those who are likely to remain interested in the
company even without additional advertising. Consequently, those loyal
customers would likely purchase from the company if they are interested in the
product. In contrast, people with lower loyalty may overlook the product or buy
similar products from other companies unless they receive marketing attention.
Therefore, by focusing marketing efforts on individuals who are interested in
the product but do not have strong loyalty, we can achieve more efficient
marketing. To achieve this goal, we consider how to learn, from limited data, a
classifier that identifies potential customers who (i) have interest in the
product and (ii) do not have loyalty to the company. Although our algorithm
comprises a single-stage optimization, its objective function implicitly
contains two losses derived from standard PU learning settings. For this
reason, we refer to our approach as double PU learning. We verify the validity
of the proposed algorithm through numerical experiments, confirming that it
functions appropriately for the problem at hand.

Conclusion: ConfExplainer通过引入置信度评分，有效解决了GNN解释的可靠性问题，为实际应用提供了更可信的解释工具。

Abstract: Explaining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has garnered significant attention
due to the need for interpretability, enabling users to understand the behavior
of these black-box models better and extract valuable insights from their
predictions. While numerous post-hoc instance-level explanation methods have
been proposed to interpret GNN predictions, the reliability of these
explanations remains uncertain, particularly in the out-of-distribution or
unknown test datasets. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing
an explainer framework with the confidence scoring module ( ConfExplainer),
grounded in theoretical principle, which is generalized graph information
bottleneck with confidence constraint (GIB-CC), that quantifies the reliability
of generated explanations. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of
our approach, highlighting the effectiveness of the confidence score in
enhancing the trustworthiness and robustness of GNN explanations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的动态权重调整方法（RLAE），用于优化大语言模型（LLM）的集成效果，显著提升了任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集成方法采用固定权重策略，无法适应LLM能力的动态和上下文相关特性。

Method: 将LLM集成问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），通过强化学习代理动态调整权重，结合输入上下文和中间生成状态。

Result: 在多种任务上，RLAE比传统方法准确率提升高达3.3%，且具有更好的泛化能力和更低延迟。

Conclusion: RLAE为LLM集成提供了更有效的框架，无需重新训练即可适应不同任务。

Abstract: Ensembling large language models (LLMs) can effectively combine diverse
strengths of different models, offering a promising approach to enhance
performance across various tasks. However, existing methods typically rely on
fixed weighting strategies that fail to adapt to the dynamic, context-dependent
characteristics of LLM capabilities. In this work, we propose Reinforcement
Learning-Assisted Ensemble for LLMs (RLAE), a novel framework that reformulates
LLM ensemble through the lens of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our approach
introduces a RL agent that dynamically adjusts ensemble weights by considering
both input context and intermediate generation states, with the agent being
trained using rewards that directly correspond to the quality of final outputs.
We implement RLAE using both single-agent and multi-agent reinforcement
learning algorithms ($\text{RLAE}_\text{PPO}$ and $\text{RLAE}_\text{MAPPO}$ ),
demonstrating substantial improvements over conventional ensemble methods.
Extensive evaluations on a diverse set of tasks show that RLAE outperforms
existing approaches by up to $3.3\%$ accuracy points, offering a more effective
framework for LLM ensembling. Furthermore, our method exhibits superior
generalization capabilities across different tasks without the need for
retraining, while simultaneously achieving lower time latency.

Motivation: 随着Vision Transformer（ViT）在计算机视觉任务中表现出优于CNN的性能，探索其在RUL预测中的潜力成为自然趋势，但直接应用于多元时间序列数据存在空间信息模糊的挑战。

Method: 提出PerFormer方法，通过排列多元时间序列数据模拟图像空间特性，并设计了一种新的排列损失函数以生成所需的排列矩阵。

Result: 在NASA的C-MAPSS数据集上，PerFormer在RUL预测中表现优于基于CNN、RNN和其他Transformer模型的现有方法。

Conclusion: PerFormer展示了在PHM应用中的高效性和潜力，为RUL预测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) for degradation systems
is crucial in modern prognostic and health management (PHM). Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), initially developed for tasks like image and video
recognition, have proven highly effectively in RUL prediction, demonstrating
remarkable performance. However, with the emergence of the Vision Transformer
(ViT), a Transformer model tailored for computer vision tasks such as image
classification, and its demonstrated superiority over CNNs, there is a natural
inclination to explore its potential in enhancing RUL prediction accuracy.
Nonetheless, applying ViT directly to multivariate sensor data for RUL
prediction poses challenges, primarily due to the ambiguous nature of spatial
information in time series data. To address this issue, we introduce the
PerFormer, a permutation-based vision transformer approach designed to permute
multivariate time series data, mimicking spatial characteristics akin to image
data, thereby making it suitable for ViT. To generate the desired permutation
matrix, we introduce a novel permutation loss function aimed at guiding the
convergence of any matrix towards a permutation matrix. Our experiments on
NASA's C-MAPSS dataset demonstrate the PerFormer's superior performance in RUL
prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods employing CNNs, Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs), and various Transformer models. This underscores its
effectiveness and potential in PHM applications.

Abstract: Dynamic graphs evolve continuously, presenting challenges for traditional
graph learning due to their changing structures and temporal dependencies.
Recent advancements have shown potential in addressing these challenges by
developing suitable meta-learning-based dynamic graph neural network models.
However, most meta-learning approaches for dynamic graphs rely on fixed weight
update parameters, neglecting the essential intrinsic complex high-order
topological information of dynamically evolving graphs. We have designed Dowker
Zigzag Persistence (DZP), an efficient and stable dynamic graph persistent
homology representation method based on Dowker complex and zigzag persistence,
to capture the high-order features of dynamic graphs. Armed with the DZP ideas,
we propose TMetaNet, a new meta-learning parameter update model based on
dynamic topological features. By utilizing the distances between high-order
topological features, TMetaNet enables more effective adaptation across
snapshots. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate TMetaNet's
state-of-the-art performance and resilience to graph noise, illustrating its
high potential for meta-learning and dynamic graph analysis. Our code is

Abstract: Hanabi has become a popular game for research when it comes to reinforcement
learning (RL) as it is one of the few cooperative card games where you have
incomplete knowledge of the entire environment, thus presenting a challenge for
a RL agent. We explored different tabular and deep reinforcement learning
algorithms to see which had the best performance both against an agent of the
same type and also against other types of agents. We establish that certain
agents played their highest scoring games against specific agents while others
exhibited higher scores on average by adapting to the opposing agent's
behavior. We attempted to quantify the conditions under which each algorithm
provides the best advantage and identified the most interesting interactions
between agents of different types. In the end, we found that temporal
difference (TD) algorithms had better overall performance and balancing of play
types compared to tabular agents. Specifically, tabular Expected SARSA and deep
Q-Learning agents showed the best performance.

Result: SST在ImageNet-1K基准测试中表现优异，仅用10%标注数据即超越全监督模型性能。

Conclusion: SST为半监督学习提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，显著减少了对标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Neural networks have demonstrated exceptional performance in supervised
learning, benefiting from abundant high-quality annotated data. However,
obtaining such data in real-world scenarios is costly and labor-intensive.
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a solution to this problem. Recent
studies, such as Semi-ViT and Noisy Student, which employ consistency
regularization or pseudo-labeling, have demonstrated significant achievements.
However, they still face challenges, particularly in accurately selecting
sufficient high-quality pseudo-labels due to their reliance on fixed
thresholds. Recent methods such as FlexMatch and FreeMatch have introduced
flexible or self-adaptive thresholding techniques, greatly advancing SSL
research. Nonetheless, their process of updating thresholds at each iteration
is deemed time-consuming, computationally intensive, and potentially
unnecessary. To address these issues, we propose Self-training with
Self-adaptive Thresholding (SST), a novel, effective, and efficient SSL
framework. SST introduces an innovative Self-Adaptive Thresholding (SAT)
mechanism that adaptively adjusts class-specific thresholds based on the
model's learning progress. SAT ensures the selection of high-quality
pseudo-labeled data, mitigating the risks of inaccurate pseudo-labels and
confirmation bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SST achieves
state-of-the-art performance with remarkable efficiency, generalization, and
scalability across various architectures and datasets. Semi-SST-ViT-Huge
achieves the best results on competitive ImageNet-1K SSL benchmarks, with 80.7%
/ 84.9% Top-1 accuracy using only 1% / 10% labeled data. Compared to the
fully-supervised DeiT-III-ViT-Huge, which achieves 84.8% Top-1 accuracy using
100% labeled data, our method demonstrates superior performance using only 10%

Motivation: 解决持续学习中模型在保留旧知识的同时学习新知识的平衡问题。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准上，FL 平均准确率提升达 4.91%（类增量）和 3.51%（任务增量），并在 ImageNet 等挑战性数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FL 有效平衡了稳定性和可塑性，显著提升了持续学习性能。

Abstract: We introduce Flashback Learning (FL), a novel method designed to harmonize
the stability and plasticity of models in Continual Learning (CL). Unlike prior
approaches that primarily focus on regularizing model updates to preserve old
information while learning new concepts, FL explicitly balances this trade-off
through a bidirectional form of regularization. This approach effectively
guides the model to swiftly incorporate new knowledge while actively retaining
its old knowledge. FL operates through a two-phase training process and can be
seamlessly integrated into various CL methods, including replay, parameter
regularization, distillation, and dynamic architecture techniques. In designing
FL, we use two distinct knowledge bases: one to enhance plasticity and another
to improve stability. FL ensures a more balanced model by utilizing both
knowledge bases to regularize model updates. Theoretically, we analyze how the
FL mechanism enhances the stability-plasticity balance. Empirically, FL
demonstrates tangible improvements over baseline methods within the same
training budget. By integrating FL into at least one representative baseline
from each CL category, we observed an average accuracy improvement of up to
4.91% in Class-Incremental and 3.51% in Task-Incremental settings on standard
image classification benchmarks. Additionally, measurements of the
stability-to-plasticity ratio confirm that FL effectively enhances this
balance. FL also outperforms state-of-the-art CL methods on more challenging
datasets like ImageNet.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the need for up-to-date
and well-organized benchmarks becomes increasingly critical. However, many
existing datasets are scattered, difficult to manage, and make it challenging
to perform evaluations tailored to specific needs or domains, despite the
growing importance of domain-specific models in areas such as math or code. In
this paper, we introduce BenchHub, a dynamic benchmark repository that empowers
researchers and developers to evaluate LLMs more effectively. BenchHub
aggregates and automatically classifies benchmark datasets from diverse
domains, integrating 303K questions across 38 benchmarks. It is designed to
support continuous updates and scalable data management, enabling flexible and
customizable evaluation tailored to various domains or use cases. Through
extensive experiments with various LLM families, we demonstrate that model
performance varies significantly across domain-specific subsets, emphasizing
the importance of domain-aware benchmarking. We believe BenchHub can encourage
better dataset reuse, more transparent model comparisons, and easier
identification of underrepresented areas in existing benchmarks, offering a
critical infrastructure for advancing LLM evaluation research.

TL;DR: DDA-PIGCN是一种结合时空特征的图卷积网络方法，用于解决AC-OPF中的约束建模问题，表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AC-OPF求解器难以有效建模约束空间与最优解之间的复杂关系，且缺乏时空信息的整合。

Method: 提出DDA-PIGCN，通过多层硬物理约束和动态域适应学习机制，结合电网物理结构捕捉时空依赖。

Result: 在多个IEEE标准测试案例中表现优异，MAE低至0.0011，约束满足率高达99.6%-100%。

Conclusion: DDA-PIGCN是一种可靠且高效的AC-OPF求解器，解决了约束建模和时空信息整合的挑战。

Abstract: Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) aims to optimize generator
power outputs by utilizing the non-linear relationships between voltage
magnitudes and phase angles in a power system. However, current AC-OPF solvers
struggle to effectively represent the complex relationship between variable
distributions in the constraint space and their corresponding optimal
solutions. This limitation in constraint modeling restricts the system's
ability to develop diverse knowledge representations. Additionally, modeling
the power grid solely based on spatial topology further limits the integration
of additional prior knowledge, such as temporal information. To overcome these
challenges, we propose DDA-PIGCN (Dynamic Domain Adaptation-Driven
Physics-Informed Graph Convolutional Network), a new method designed to address
constraint-related issues and build a graph-based learning framework that
incorporates spatiotemporal features. DDA-PIGCN improves consistency
optimization for features with varying long-range dependencies by applying
multi-layer, hard physics-informed constraints. It also uses a dynamic domain
adaptation learning mechanism that iteratively updates and refines key state
variables under predefined constraints, enabling precise constraint
verification. Moreover, it captures spatiotemporal dependencies between
generators and loads by leveraging the physical structure of the power grid,
allowing for deep integration of topological information across time and space.
Extensive comparative and ablation studies show that DDA-PIGCN delivers strong
performance across several IEEE standard test cases (such as case9, case30, and
case300), achieving mean absolute errors (MAE) from 0.0011 to 0.0624 and
constraint satisfaction rates between 99.6% and 100%, establishing it as a
reliable and efficient AC-OPF solver.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM研究快速发展，但模型参数的统计分布及其对初始化、训练动态和下游效率的影响研究较少。BackSlash算法的成功表明GGD更适合描述LLM参数分布。

Method: 提出GG-based初始化方案、DeepShape后训练正则化方法和RF8硬件高效8位浮点格式，结合BackSlash压缩算法，优化LLM。

Conclusion: 通过统计建模优化LLM，为高效、可扩展且硬件感知的AI系统开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in the research and deployment of large language
models (LLMs), the statistical distribution of model parameters, as well as
their influence on initialization, training dynamics, and downstream
efficiency, has received surprisingly little attention. A recent work
introduced BackSlash, a training-time compression algorithm. It first
demonstrated that pre-trained LLM parameters follow generalized Gaussian
distributions (GGDs) better. By optimizing GG priors during training, BackSlash
can reduce parameters by up to 90\% with minimal performance loss. Building on
this foundational insight, we propose a unified, end-to-end framework for LLM
optimization based on the GG model. Our contributions are threefold: (1)
GG-based initialization scheme that aligns with the statistical structure of
trained models, resulting in faster convergence and improved accuracy; (2)
DeepShape, a post-training regularization method that reshapes weight
distributions to match a GG profile, improving compressibility with minimized
degradation in performance; and (3) RF8, a compact and hardware-efficient 8-bit
floating-point format designed for GG-distributed-initialized BackSlash
training, enabling low-cost inference without compromising accuracy.
Experiments across diverse model architectures show that our framework
consistently yields smaller and faster models that match or outperform standard
training baselines. By grounding LLM development in principled statistical
modeling, this work forges a new path toward efficient, scalable, and
hardware-aware AI systems. The code is available on our project page:

TL;DR: MMedAgent-RL 是一种基于强化学习的多智能体框架，通过动态协作优化医疗诊断任务，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单智能体模型在跨医疗领域泛化能力不足，静态多智能体协作框架缺乏灵活性。

Method: 使用强化学习训练两个基于 Qwen2.5-VL 的 GP 智能体：分诊医生和主治医生，并引入课程学习策略优化协作。

Result: 在五个医疗 VQA 基准测试中，MMedAgent-RL 性能优于现有模型，平均提升 18.4%。

Conclusion: MMedAgent-RL 实现了动态协作和人类化推理，为医疗多模态任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown strong potential
in multimodal diagnostic tasks. However, existing single-agent models struggle
to generalize across diverse medical specialties, limiting their performance.
Recent efforts introduce multi-agent collaboration frameworks inspired by
clinical workflows, where general practitioners (GPs) and specialists interact
in a fixed sequence. Despite improvements, these static pipelines lack
flexibility and adaptability in reasoning. To address this, we propose
MMedAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent framework that
enables dynamic, optimized collaboration among medical agents. Specifically, we
train two GP agents based on Qwen2.5-VL via RL: the triage doctor learns to
assign patients to appropriate specialties, while the attending physician
integrates the judgments from multi-specialists and its own knowledge to make
final decisions. To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we
introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy that progressively
teaches the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and
correcting their mistakes. Experiments on five medical VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that MMedAgent-RL not only outperforms both open-source and
proprietary Med-LVLMs, but also exhibits human-like reasoning patterns.
Notably, it achieves an average performance gain of 18.4% over supervised
fine-tuning baselines.

introduce QoQ-Med-7B/32B, the first open generalist clinical foundation model

(DRPO), a novel reinforcement-learning objective that hierarchically scales
normalized rewards according to domain rarity and modality difficulty,
mitigating performance imbalance caused by skewed clinical data distributions.
Trained on 2.61 million instruction tuning pairs spanning 9 clinical domains,
we show that DRPO training boosts diagnostic performance by 43% in macro-F1 on
average across all visual domains as compared to other critic-free training
methods like GRPO. Furthermore, with QoQ-Med trained on intensive segmentation
data, it is able to highlight salient regions related to the diagnosis, with an
IoU 10x higher than open models while reaching the performance of OpenAI
o4-mini. To foster reproducibility and downstream research, we release (i) the

Abstract: The integration of wind energy into power grids necessitates accurate
ultra-short-term wind power forecasting to ensure grid stability and optimize
resource allocation. This study introduces M2WLLM, an innovative model that
leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for predicting wind

forecasting accuracy through multi-modal data. Its architecture features a
Prompt Embedder and a Data Embedder, enabling an effective fusion of textual
prompts and numerical inputs within the LLMs framework. The Semantic Augmenter
within the Data Embedder translates temporal data into a format that the LLMs
can comprehend, enabling it to extract latent features and improve prediction
accuracy. The empirical evaluations conducted on wind farm data from three
Chinese provinces demonstrate that M2WLLM consistently outperforms existing
methods, such as GPT4TS, across various datasets and prediction horizons. The
results highlight LLMs' ability to enhance accuracy and robustness in
ultra-short-term forecasting and showcase their strong few-shot learning

Conclusion: 该方法具有灵活性和适应性，适用于4D流MRI以外的其他医学成像应用。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have shown robust results in
plane reformatting tasks. In these methods, an agent sequentially adjusts the
position and orientation of an initial plane towards an objective location.
This process allows accurate plane reformatting, without the need for detailed
landmarks, which makes it suitable for images with limited contrast and
resolution, such as 4D flow MRI. However, current DRL methods require the test
dataset to be in the same position and orientation as the training dataset. In
this paper, we present a novel technique that utilizes a flexible coordinate
system based on the current state, enabling navigation in volumes at any
position or orientation. We adopted the Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic
(A3C) algorithm for reinforcement learning, outperforming Deep Q Network (DQN).
Experimental results in 4D flow MRI demonstrate improved accuracy in plane
reformatting angular and distance errors (6.32 +- 4.15 {\deg} and 3.40 +- 2.75
mm), as well as statistically equivalent flow measurements determined by a
plane reformatting process done by an expert (p=0.21). The method's flexibility
and adaptability make it a promising candidate for other medical imaging
applications beyond 4D flow MRI.

Abstract: Missing data is a relevant issue in time series, especially in biomedical
sequences such as those corresponding to smooth pursuit eye movements, which
often contain gaps due to eye blinks and track losses, complicating the
analysis and extraction of meaningful biomarkers. In this paper, a novel
imputation framework is proposed using Self-Attention-based Imputation networks
for time series, which leverages the power of deep learning and self-attention
mechanisms to impute missing data. We further refine the imputed data using a
custom made autoencoder, tailored to represent smooth pursuit eye movement
sequences. The proposed approach was implemented using 5,504 sequences from 172
Parkinsonian patients and healthy controls. Results show a significant
improvement in the accuracy of reconstructed eye movement sequences with
respect to other state of the art techniques, substantially reducing the values
for common time domain error metrics such as the mean absolute error, mean
relative error, and root mean square error, while also preserving the signal's
frequency domain characteristics. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness when
large intervals of data are missing. This method offers an alternative solution
for robustly handling missing data in time series, enhancing the reliability of
smooth pursuit analysis for the screening and monitoring of neurodegenerative
disorders.

Conclusion: 论文为度量学习在深度强化学习中的应用提供了系统性评估，揭示了其性能提升的来源，并推动了未来研究的发展。

Abstract: A key approach to state abstraction is approximating behavioral metrics
(notably, bisimulation metrics) in the observation space and embedding these
learned distances in the representation space. While promising for robustness
to task-irrelevant noise, as shown in prior work, accurately estimating these
metrics remains challenging, requiring various design choices that create gaps
between theory and practice. Prior evaluations focus mainly on final returns,
leaving the quality of learned metrics and the source of performance gains
unclear. To systematically assess how metric learning works in deep
reinforcement learning (RL), we evaluate five recent approaches, unified
conceptually as isometric embeddings with varying design choices. We benchmark
them with baselines across 20 state-based and 14 pixel-based tasks, spanning
370 task configurations with diverse noise settings. Beyond final returns, we
introduce the evaluation of a denoising factor to quantify the encoder's
ability to filter distractions. To further isolate the effect of metric
learning, we propose and evaluate an isolated metric estimation setting, in
which the encoder is influenced solely by the metric loss. Finally, we release
an open-source, modular codebase to improve reproducibility and support future
research on metric learning in deep RL.

Motivation: 传统DRL在动态无线网络环境中难以处理分散和演化的反馈，LLM能结构化网络反馈为有意义的潜在表示，帮助RL代理更有效识别模式。

Method: 引入基于上下文的自适应方法，将可学习提示集成到LLM增强的DRL框架中，动态调整网络状态表示，避免全模型微调。

Result: 实验结果表明，PA-MRL框架加速了收敛速度，并在O-RAN切片中优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过提示增强学习，该方法实现了更快、更可扩展和自适应的资源分配，适用于动态无线网络环境。

Abstract: Modern wireless networks must adapt to dynamic conditions while efficiently
managing diverse service demands. Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
struggles in these environments, as scattered and evolving feedback makes
optimal decision-making challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a
solution by structuring unorganized network feedback into meaningful latent
representations, helping RL agents recognize patterns more effectively. For
example, in O-RAN slicing, concepts like SNR, power levels and throughput are
semantically related, and LLMs can naturally cluster them, providing a more
interpretable state representation. To leverage this capability, we introduce a
contextualization-based adaptation method that integrates learnable prompts
into an LLM-augmented DRL framework. Instead of relying on full model
fine-tuning, we refine state representations through task-specific prompts that
dynamically adjust to network conditions. Utilizing ORANSight, an LLM trained
on O-RAN knowledge, we develop Prompt-Augmented Multi agent RL (PA-MRL)
framework. Learnable prompts optimize both semantic clustering and RL
objectives, allowing RL agents to achieve higher rewards in fewer iterations
and adapt more efficiently. By incorporating prompt-augmented learning, our
approach enables faster, more scalable, and adaptive resource allocation in
O-RAN slicing. Experimental results show that it accelerates convergence and
outperforms other baselines.

Result: 实验表明，ORAN-GUIDE在样本效率、策略收敛和性能泛化上优于标准MARL和单LLM基线。

Conclusion: ORAN-GUIDE为无线网络中的动态资源分配提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Advanced wireless networks must support highly dynamic and heterogeneous
service demands. Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture enables this
flexibility by adopting modular, disaggregated components, such as the RAN
Intelligent Controller (RIC), Centralized Unit (CU), and Distributed Unit (DU),
that can support intelligent control via machine learning (ML). While deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) is a powerful tool for managing dynamic resource
allocation and slicing, it often struggles to process raw, unstructured input
like RF features, QoS metrics, and traffic trends. These limitations hinder
policy generalization and decision efficiency in partially observable and
evolving environments. To address this, we propose \textit{ORAN-GUIDE}, a
dual-LLM framework that enhances multi-agent RL (MARL) with task-relevant,
semantically enriched state representations. The architecture employs a
domain-specific language model, ORANSight, pretrained on O-RAN control and
configuration data, to generate structured, context-aware prompts. These
prompts are fused with learnable tokens and passed to a frozen GPT-based
encoder that outputs high-level semantic representations for DRL agents. This
design adopts a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) style pipeline tailored
for technical decision-making in wireless systems. Experimental results show
that ORAN-GUIDE improves sample efficiency, policy convergence, and performance
generalization over standard MARL and single-LLM baselines.

Conclusion: DVP通过解耦和重加权优化视觉提示，提升了模型性能，并提供了可解释的分类框架。

Abstract: Model reprogramming adapts pretrained models to downstream tasks by modifying
only the input and output spaces. Visual reprogramming (VR) is one instance for
vision tasks that adds a trainable noise pattern (i.e., a visual prompt) to
input images to facilitate downstream classification. The existing VR
approaches for CLIP train a single visual prompt using all descriptions of
different downstream classes. However, the limited learning capacity may result
in (1) a failure to capture diverse aspects of the descriptions (e.g., shape,
color, and texture), and (2) a possible bias toward less informative attributes
that do not help distinguish between classes. In this paper, we introduce a
decoupling-and-reweighting framework. Our decoupled visual prompts (DVP) are
optimized using descriptions grouped by explicit causes (DVP-cse) or
unsupervised clusters (DVP-cls). Then, we integrate the outputs of these visual
prompts with a probabilistic reweighting matrix (PRM) that measures their
contributions to each downstream class. Theoretically, DVP lowers the empirical
risk bound. Experimentally, DVP outperforms baselines on average across 11
downstream datasets. Notably, the DVP-PRM integration enables insights into how
individual visual prompts influence classification decisions, providing a
probabilistic framework for understanding reprogramming. Our code is available

Abstract: In this pilot study, we propose a neuro-inspired approach that compresses
temporal sequences into context-tagged chunks, where each tag represents a
recurring structural unit or``community'' in the sequence. These tags are
generated during an offline sleep phase and serve as compact references to past
experience, allowing the learner to incorporate information beyond its
immediate input range. We evaluate this idea in a controlled synthetic
environment designed to reveal the limitations of traditional neural network
based sequence learners, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), when facing
temporal patterns on multiple timescales. We evaluate this idea in a controlled
synthetic environment designed to reveal the limitations of traditional neural
network based sequence learners, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), when
facing temporal patterns on multiple timescales. Our results, while
preliminary, suggest that temporal chunking can significantly enhance learning
efficiency under resource constrained settings. A small-scale human pilot study
using a Serial Reaction Time Task further motivates the idea of structural
abstraction. Although limited to synthetic tasks, this work serves as an early
proof-of-concept, with initial evidence that learned context tags can transfer
across related task, offering potential for future applications in transfer
learning.

Method: 从网络输出变异性（churn）角度分析塑性丧失，提出减少churn的方法（C-CHAIN）。

Result: 减少churn可防止NTK矩阵秩的下降，提升学习性能，C-CHAIN在多个基准测试中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过减少churn可有效防止塑性丧失，C-CHAIN方法在持续学习任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Plasticity, or the ability of an agent to adapt to new tasks, environments,
or distributions, is crucial for continual learning. In this paper, we study
the loss of plasticity in deep continual RL from the lens of churn: network
output variability for out-of-batch data induced by mini-batch training. We
demonstrate that (1) the loss of plasticity is accompanied by the exacerbation
of churn due to the gradual rank decrease of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)
matrix; (2) reducing churn helps prevent rank collapse and adjusts the step
size of regular RL gradients adaptively. Moreover, we introduce Continual Churn
Approximated Reduction (C-CHAIN) and demonstrate it improves learning
performance and outperforms baselines in a diverse range of continual learning
environments on OpenAI Gym Control, ProcGen, DeepMind Control Suite, and
MinAtar benchmarks.

Result: 实验表明GEL在性能和鲁棒性上均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: GEL通过引入不确定性量化，显著提升了图异常检测的效果和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of
reliable anomaly-labeled datasets, driving the development of unsupervised
methods. Graph autoencoders (GAEs) have emerged as a dominant approach by
reconstructing graph structures and node features while deriving anomaly scores
from reconstruction errors. However, relying solely on reconstruction error for
anomaly detection has limitations, as it increases the sensitivity to noise and
overfitting. To address these issues, we propose Graph Evidential Learning
(GEL), a probabilistic framework that redefines the reconstruction process
through evidential learning. By modeling node features and graph topology using
evidential distributions, GEL quantifies two types of uncertainty: graph
uncertainty and reconstruction uncertainty, incorporating them into the anomaly
scoring mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GEL achieves
state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high robustness against noise
and structural perturbations.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce $\Psi$-Sampler, an SMC-based framework incorporating pCNL-based
initial particle sampling for effective inference-time reward alignment with a
score-based generative model. Inference-time reward alignment with score-based
generative models has recently gained significant traction, following a broader
paradigm shift from pre-training to post-training optimization. At the core of
this trend is the application of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to the denoising
process. However, existing methods typically initialize particles from the
Gaussian prior, which inadequately captures reward-relevant regions and results
in reduced sampling efficiency. We demonstrate that initializing from the
reward-aware posterior significantly improves alignment performance. To enable
posterior sampling in high-dimensional latent spaces, we introduce the
preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin (pCNL) algorithm, which combines
dimension-robust proposals with gradient-informed dynamics. This approach
enables efficient and scalable posterior sampling and consistently improves
performance across various reward alignment tasks, including layout-to-image
generation, quantity-aware generation, and aesthetic-preference generation, as
demonstrated in our experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中对多通道时间序列预测效率的需求日益增长，尤其是在边缘和云环境中，因此需要有效的通道压缩方法。

Method: 使用具有正交性的周期性关键矩阵来捕捉时间序列的可预测性，并在解压缩时通过放宽简化假设减少重构误差。

Result: 理论和实验表明，该方法在大量通道下具有时间高效性和可扩展性，并在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持预测精度的同时显著提高了效率，且与多种预测器兼容。

Abstract: Real-world multichannel time series prediction faces growing demands for
efficiency across edge and cloud environments, making channel compression a
timely and essential problem. Motivated by success of Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output (MIMO) methods, we propose a predictability-aware
compression-decompression framework to reduce runtime, lower communication
cost, and maintain prediction accuracy across diverse predictors. The core idea
involves using a circular periodicity key matrix with orthogonality to capture
underlying time series predictability during compression and to mitigate
reconstruction errors during decompression by relaxing oversimplified data
assumptions. Theoretical and empirical analyses show that the proposed
framework is both time-efficient and scalable under a large number of channels.
Extensive experiments on six datasets across various predictors demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior overall performance by jointly
considering prediction accuracy and runtime, while maintaining strong
compatibility with diverse predictors.

*Sujeevan Aseervatham,Achraf Kerzazi,Younès Bennani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的防御方法，用于检测和消除AI模型中的后门攻击，无需依赖干净数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后门攻击因其隐蔽性对AI模型构成严重威胁，现有防御方法依赖干净数据集，但实际场景中可能无法获取。

Method: 通过训练模型检测中毒类别，提取攻击触发器的关键部分，并识别中毒实例。

Result: 实验证明该方法在知名图像数据集上有效，优于SCAn、ABL和AGPD三种先进算法。

Conclusion: 新方法提高了防御的可解释性，适用于无干净数据集的场景。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a subtle yet effective class of cyberattacks
targeting AI models, primarily due to their stealthy nature. The model behaves
normally on clean data but exhibits malicious behavior only when the attacker
embeds a specific trigger into the input. This attack is performed during the
training phase, where the adversary corrupts a small subset of the training
data by embedding a pattern and modifying the labels to a chosen target. The
objective is to make the model associate the pattern with the target label
while maintaining normal performance on unaltered data. Several defense
mechanisms have been proposed to sanitize training data-sets. However, these
methods often rely on the availability of a clean dataset to compute
statistical anomalies, which may not always be feasible in real-world scenarios
where datasets can be unavailable or compromised. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel defense method that trains a model on the given dataset,
detects poisoned classes, and extracts the critical part of the attack trigger
before identifying the poisoned instances. This approach enhances
explainability by explicitly revealing the harmful part of the trigger. The
effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through experimental evaluations on
well-known image datasets and comparative analysis against three
state-of-the-art algorithms: SCAn, ABL, and AGPD.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ST-TTC的新方法，通过测试时校准学习改进时空预测的准确性，避免了复杂训练阶段技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中的时空预测常受信号异常、噪声和分布偏移的挑战，现有方法计算资源消耗大。

Method: 引入频谱域校准器和相位-幅度调制以减轻周期性偏移，并提出流式内存队列的快速更新机制。

Result: 实验证明该方法在有效性、通用性、灵活性和效率上表现优异。

Conclusion: ST-TTC为时空预测提供了一种高效且通用的测试时计算范式。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is crucial in many domains, such as
transportation, meteorology, and energy. However, real-world scenarios
frequently present challenges such as signal anomalies, noise, and
distributional shifts. Existing solutions primarily enhance robustness by
modifying network architectures or training procedures. Nevertheless, these
approaches are computationally intensive and resource-demanding, especially for
large-scale applications. In this paper, we explore a novel test-time computing
paradigm, namely learning with calibration, ST-TTC, for spatio-temporal
forecasting. Through learning with calibration, we aim to capture periodic
structural biases arising from non-stationarity during the testing phase and
perform real-time bias correction on predictions to improve accuracy.
Specifically, we first introduce a spectral-domain calibrator with
phase-amplitude modulation to mitigate periodic shift and then propose a flash
updating mechanism with a streaming memory queue for efficient test-time
computation. ST-TTC effectively bypasses complex training-stage techniques,
offering an efficient and generalizable paradigm. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, universality, flexibility
and efficiency of our proposed method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出线性表示可转移性（LRT）假说，认为不同模型的表示空间之间存在仿射变换关系，并通过实验验证小模型的行为导向向量可以通过仿射映射在大模型中保留语义效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同规模模型在相同数据上学习到的表示是否具有共享的基础特征，以及这些特征是否可以通过仿射变换在不同模型间转移。

Method: 提出LRT假说，学习不同规模模型隐藏状态之间的仿射映射，并评估行为导向向量在映射后的语义效果。

Result: 实验表明仿射映射能有效保留行为导向向量的语义效果，支持LRT假说。

Conclusion: 小模型的表示可以用于指导大模型的行为，LRT假说为理解跨模型规模的表示对齐提供了新方向。

Abstract: It has been hypothesized that neural networks with similar architectures
trained on similar data learn shared representations relevant to the learning
task. We build on this idea by extending the conceptual framework where
representations learned across models trained on the same data can be expressed
as linear combinations of a \emph{universal} set of basis features. These basis
features underlie the learning task itself and remain consistent across models,
regardless of scale. From this framework, we propose the \textbf{Linear
Representation Transferability (LRT)} Hypothesis -- that there exists an affine
transformation between the representation spaces of different models. To test
this hypothesis, we learn affine mappings between the hidden states of models
of different sizes and evaluate whether steering vectors -- directions in
hidden state space associated with specific model behaviors -- retain their
semantic effect when transferred from small to large language models using the
learned mappings. We find strong empirical evidence that such affine mappings
can preserve steering behaviors. These findings suggest that representations
learned by small models can be used to guide the behavior of large models, and
that the LRT hypothesis may be a promising direction on understanding
representation alignment across model scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据集论文缺乏原创性、多样性和严格的质量控制，且构建细节常被忽略，现有工具（如datasheets）未能提供标准化评估方法。

Method: 提出DataRubrics框架，结合LLM-based评估方法，提供可重复、可扩展的数据集质量评估方案。

Result: DataRubrics为数据集质量评估提供了结构化、可操作的解决方案，支持更高效的数据生成与评估。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁在数据集评审中采用系统化评估指标，并开源代码以支持LLM-based评估的复现性。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are fundamental to training and evaluating machine
learning models, yet their creation-especially with accurate human
annotations-remains a significant challenge. Many dataset paper submissions
lack originality, diversity, or rigorous quality control, and these
shortcomings are often overlooked during peer review. Submissions also
frequently omit essential details about dataset construction and properties.
While existing tools such as datasheets aim to promote transparency, they are
largely descriptive and do not provide standardized, measurable methods for
evaluating data quality. Similarly, metadata requirements at conferences
promote accountability but are inconsistently enforced. To address these
limitations, this position paper advocates for the integration of systematic,
rubric-based evaluation metrics into the dataset review process-particularly as
submission volumes continue to grow. We also explore scalable, cost-effective
methods for synthetic data generation, including dedicated tools and
LLM-as-a-judge approaches, to support more efficient evaluation. As a call to
action, we introduce DataRubrics, a structured framework for assessing the
quality of both human- and model-generated datasets. Leveraging recent advances
in LLM-based evaluation, DataRubrics offers a reproducible, scalable, and
actionable solution for dataset quality assessment, enabling both authors and
reviewers to uphold higher standards in data-centric research. We also release
code to support reproducibility of LLM-based evaluations at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Wi-Fi信号数据稀疏、无序的特性，提升室内定位的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 将RSSI扫描建模为无序集合，使用Set Transformer学习信号关系，并与LSTM等模型对比。

Result: LSTM表现最佳（平均误差2.23米），Set Transformer次之，尤其在多建筑和多楼层任务中优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 基于集合的神经网络模型适合信号定位任务，能有效处理稀疏无序输入。

Abstract: We propose a permutation-invariant neural architecture for indoor
localization using RSSI scans from Wi-Fi access points. Each scan is modeled as
an unordered set of (BSSID, RSSI) pairs, where BSSIDs are mapped to learned
embeddings and concatenated with signal strength. These are processed by a Set
Transformer, enabling the model to handle variable-length, sparse inputs while
learning attention- based representations over access point relationships. We
evaluate the model on a dataset collected across a campus environment
consisting of six buildings. Results show that the model accurately recovers
fine-grained spatial structure and maintains performance across physically
distinct domains. In our experiments, a simple LSTM consistently outperformed
all other models, achieving the lowest mean localization error across three
tasks (E1 - E3), with average errors as low as 2.23 m. The Set Transformer
performed competitively, ranking second in every experiment and outperforming
the MLP, RNN, and basic attention models, particularly in scenarios involving
multiple buildings (E2) and multiple floors (E3). Performance degraded most in
E2, where signal conditions varied substantially across buildings, highlighting
the importance of architectural robustness to domain diversity. This work
demonstrates that set-based neural models are a natural fit for signal-based
localization, offering a principled approach to handling sparse, unordered
inputs in real-world positioning tasks.

TL;DR: 本文综述了差分隐私（DP）在医疗深度学习中的应用，分析了隐私保护与模型性能、公平性之间的权衡，并指出了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着医疗深度学习对数据的依赖性增加，如何在保护患者隐私的同时保持模型性能和公平性成为关键挑战。

Method: 通过结构化搜索策略，分析了74项研究，涵盖不同数据模态、训练设置和任务，重点关注DP-SGD及其他机制在集中式和联邦式设置中的应用。

Result: 研究发现，强隐私预算下DP在结构化成像任务中表现良好，但在严格隐私条件下性能下降明显，且对少数群体影响更大。公平性分析较少。

Conclusion: 未来需关注公平性审计、标准化和评估协议，以构建更公平且临床稳健的隐私保护深度学习系统。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a key technique for protecting sensitive patient
data in medical deep learning (DL). As clinical models grow more
data-dependent, balancing privacy with utility and fairness has become a
critical challenge. This scoping review synthesizes recent developments in
applying DP to medical DL, with a particular focus on DP-SGD and alternative
mechanisms across centralized and federated settings. Using a structured search
strategy, we identified 74 studies published up to March 2025. Our analysis
spans diverse data modalities, training setups, and downstream tasks, and
highlights the tradeoffs between privacy guarantees, model accuracy, and
subgroup fairness. We find that while DP-especially at strong privacy
budgets-can preserve performance in well-structured imaging tasks, severe
degradation often occurs under strict privacy, particularly in underrepresented
or complex modalities. Furthermore, privacy-induced performance gaps
disproportionately affect demographic subgroups, with fairness impacts varying
by data type and task. A small subset of studies explicitly addresses these
tradeoffs through subgroup analysis or fairness metrics, but most omit them
entirely. Beyond DP-SGD, emerging approaches leverage alternative mechanisms,
generative models, and hybrid federated designs, though reporting remains
inconsistent. We conclude by outlining key gaps in fairness auditing,
standardization, and evaluation protocols, offering guidance for future work
toward equitable and clinically robust privacy-preserving DL systems in
medicine.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM的广泛应用，参数高效微调方法和安全防御措施迅速增多，但评估方法的多样性导致难以公平比较不同方法的安全性、实用性和鲁棒性。

Method: SafeTuneBed通过（i）整理多样化的微调数据集，（ii）集成最先进的防御措施，（iii）提供安全和实用性的评估工具，统一了评估标准。

Result: SafeTuneBed展示了在不同中毒场景和任务中代表性防御措施的基准测试效果，证明了其价值。

Conclusion: SafeTuneBed通过标准化数据、代码和指标，加速了安全LLM微调研究的严谨性和可比性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become ubiquitous, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods and safety-first defenses have proliferated rapidly.
However, the number of approaches and their recent increase have resulted in
diverse evaluations-varied datasets, metrics, and inconsistent threat
settings-making it difficult to fairly compare safety, utility, and robustness
across methods. To address this, we introduce SafeTuneBed, a benchmark and
toolkit unifying fine-tuning and defense evaluation. SafeTuneBed (i) curates a
diverse repository of multiple fine-tuning datasets spanning sentiment
analysis, question-answering, multi-step reasoning, and open-ended instruction
tasks, and allows for the generation of harmful-variant splits; (ii) enables
integration of state-of-the-art defenses, including alignment-stage
immunization, in-training safeguards, and post-tuning repair; and (iii)
provides evaluators for safety (attack success rate, refusal consistency) and
utility. Built on Python-first, dataclass-driven configs and plugins,
SafeTuneBed requires minimal additional code to specify any fine-tuning regime,
defense method, and metric suite, while ensuring end-to-end reproducibility. We
showcase its value by benchmarking representative defenses across varied
poisoning scenarios and tasks. By standardizing data, code, and metrics,
SafeTuneBed is the first focused toolkit of its kind to accelerate rigorous and
comparable research in safe LLM fine-tuning. Code is available at:

Result: 结果显示当前评估方法可能高估或低估遗忘效果，而新原则能更准确地评估遗忘性能。

Conclusion: 结论是未来评估机器遗忘时应遵循最小信息注入和下游任务意识原则，以避免误导性结论。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove sensitive or undesired data from large
language models. However, recent studies suggest that unlearning is often
shallow, claiming that removed knowledge can easily be recovered. In this work,
we critically examine standard unlearning evaluation practices and uncover key
limitations that shake our trust in those findings. First, we show that some
evaluations introduce substantial new information into the model, potentially
masking true unlearning performance by re-teaching the model during testing.
Second, we demonstrate that evaluation outcomes vary significantly across
tasks, undermining the generalizability of current evaluation routines.
Finally, we find that many evaluations rely on spurious correlations, making
their results difficult to trust and interpret. Taken together, these issues
suggest that current evaluation protocols may both overstate and understate
unlearning success. To address this, we propose two principles for future
unlearning evaluations: minimal information injection and downstream task
awareness. We validate these principles through a series of targeted
experiments, showing how violations of each can lead to misleading conclusions.

Result: 改进后的模型显著提升了学习效率和收敛速度，同时保持了性能。

Conclusion: 非线性注意力机制在强化学习算法中具有潜力，能进一步提升效率和性能。

Abstract: Training reinforcement learning (RL) agents often requires significant
computational resources and extended training times. To address this, we build
upon the foundation laid by Google Brain's Sensory Neuron, which introduced a
novel neural architecture for reinforcement learning tasks that maintained
permutation in-variance in the sensory neuron system. While the baseline model
demonstrated significant performance improvements over traditional approaches,
we identified opportunities to enhance the efficiency of the learning process
further. We propose a modified attention mechanism incorporating a non-linear
transformation of the key vectors (K) using a mapping function, resulting in a
new set of key vectors (K'). This non-linear mapping enhances the
representational capacity of the attention mechanism, allowing the model to
encode more complex feature interactions and accelerating convergence without
compromising performance. Our enhanced model demonstrates significant
improvements in learning efficiency, showcasing the potential for non-linear
attention mechanisms in advancing reinforcement learning algorithms.

Abstract: Determining whether a dataset was part of a machine learning model's training
data pool can reveal privacy vulnerabilities, a challenge often addressed
through membership inference attacks (MIAs). Traditional MIAs typically require
access to model internals or rely on computationally intensive shadow models.
This paper proposes an efficient, interpretable and principled Bayesian
inference method for membership inference. By analyzing post-hoc metrics such
as prediction error, confidence (entropy), perturbation magnitude, and dataset
statistics from a trained ML model, our approach computes posterior
probabilities of membership without requiring extensive model training.
Experimental results on synthetic datasets demonstrate the method's
effectiveness in distinguishing member from non-member datasets. Beyond
membership inference, this method can also detect distribution shifts, offering
a practical and interpretable alternative to existing approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to forecasting tasks,
with some works claiming these systems match or exceed human performance. In
this paper, we argue that, as a community, we should be careful about such
conclusions as evaluating LLM forecasters presents unique challenges. We
identify two broad categories of issues: (1) difficulty in trusting evaluation
results due to many forms of temporal leakage, and (2) difficulty in
extrapolating from evaluation performance to real-world forecasting. Through
systematic analysis and concrete examples from prior work, we demonstrate how
evaluation flaws can raise concerns about current and future performance
claims. We argue that more rigorous evaluation methodologies are needed to
confidently assess the forecasting abilities of LLMs.

Result: 在Burgers方程和TFMDWE上测试，性能优于标准PINN。

Conclusion: MoPINNEnKF框架显著提升了PINN的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for
solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations
(PDEs) by incorporating physical laws into the training process. However, the
performance of PINNs is often hindered in real-world scenarios involving noisy
observational data and missing physics, particularly in inverse problems. In
this work, we propose an iterative multi-objective PINN ensemble Kalman filter
(MoPINNEnKF) framework that improves the robustness and accuracy of PINNs in
both forward and inverse problems by using the \textit{ensemble Kalman filter}
and the \textit{non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm} III (NSGA-III).
Specifically, NSGA-III is used as a multi-objective optimizer that can generate
various ensemble members of PINNs along the optimal Pareto front, while
accounting the model uncertainty in the solution space. These ensemble members
are then utilized within the EnKF to assimilate noisy observational data. The
EnKF's analysis is subsequently used to refine the data loss component for
retraining the PINNs, thereby iteratively updating their parameters. The
iterative procedure generates improved solutions to the PDEs. The proposed
method is tested on two benchmark problems: the one-dimensional viscous Burgers
equation and the time-fractional mixed diffusion-wave equation (TFMDWE). The
numerical results show it outperforms standard PINNs in handling noisy data and
missing physics.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在新环境中的性能下降通常不均匀，某些子群受影响更大，但现有方法无法提供详细解释或针对性建议。

Method: 提出SHIFT框架，通过子群扫描和层次推理，先定位性能下降的子群，再分析具体原因（如协变量或结果偏移）。

Result: 实验表明，SHIFT能识别受性能下降影响的子群，并提供有效的针对性缓解措施。

Conclusion: SHIFT为模型性能下降提供了可解释的子群分析和实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models frequently experience performance degradation
when deployed in new contexts. Such degradation is rarely uniform: some
subgroups may suffer large performance decay while others may not.
Understanding where and how large differences in performance arise is critical
for designing targeted corrective actions that mitigate decay for the most
affected subgroups while minimizing any unintended effects. Current approaches
do not provide such detailed insight, as they either (i) explain how average
performance shifts arise or (ii) identify adversely affected subgroups without
insight into how this occurred. To this end, we introduce a Subgroup-scanning
Hierarchical Inference Framework for performance drifT (SHIFT). SHIFT first
asks "Is there any subgroup with unacceptably large performance decay due to
covariate/outcome shifts?" (Where?) and, if so, dives deeper to ask "Can we
explain this using more detailed variable(subset)-specific shifts?" (How?). In
real-world experiments, we find that SHIFT identifies interpretable subgroups
affected by performance decay, and suggests targeted actions that effectively
mitigate the decay.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GAT依赖预定义的邻接结构和动态注意力分数，存在归纳偏差和计算开销问题，影响可解释性。

Method: 提出InterGAT，用可学习的对称节点交互矩阵替代掩码注意力，结合GRU时间解码器（InterGAT-GRU）。

Result: 在SZ-Taxi和Los-Loop数据集上分别提升21%和6%的预测准确率，训练时间减少60-70%。

Conclusion: InterGAT不仅提升了性能，还通过交互矩阵揭示了可解释的空间结构，支持预测、效率和拓扑解释性。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is critical in applications such as traffic
prediction, energy demand modeling, and weather monitoring. While Graph
Attention Networks (GATs) are popular for modeling spatial dependencies, they
rely on predefined adjacency structures and dynamic attention scores,
introducing inductive biases and computational overhead that can obscure
interpretability.
  We propose InterGAT, a simplified alternative to GAT that replaces masked
attention with a fully learnable, symmetric node interaction matrix, capturing
latent spatial relationships without relying on fixed graph topologies. Our
framework, InterGAT-GRU, which incorporates a GRU-based temporal decoder,
outperforms the baseline GAT-GRU in forecasting accuracy, achieving at least a
21% improvement on the SZ-Taxi dataset and a 6% improvement on the Los-Loop
dataset across all forecasting horizons (15 to 60 minutes). Additionally, we
observed reduction in training time by 60-70% compared to GAT-GRU baseline.
  Crucially, the learned interaction matrix reveals interpretable structure: it
recovers sparse, topology-aware attention patterns that align with community
structure. Spectral and clustering analyses show that the model captures both
localized and global dynamics, offering insights into the functional topology
driving predictions. This highlights how structure learning can simultaneously
support prediction, computational efficiency, and topological interpretabil-ity
in dynamic graph-based domains.

property-guided optimization. In this work, we propose a flexible zero-shot
molecule manipulation method by navigating in a shared latent space of 3D
molecules. We introduce a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) for 3D molecules, named
MolFLAE, which learns a fixed-dimensional, SE(3)-equivariant latent space
independent of atom counts. MolFLAE encodes 3D molecules using an
SE(3)-equivariant neural network into fixed number of latent nodes,
distinguished by learned embeddings. The latent space is regularized, and
molecular structures are reconstructed via a Bayesian Flow Network (BFN)
conditioned on the encoder's latent output. MolFLAE achieves competitive
performance on standard unconditional 3D molecule generation benchmarks.
Moreover, the latent space of MolFLAE enables zero-shot molecule manipulation,
including atom number editing, structure reconstruction, and coordinated latent
interpolation for both structure and properties. We further demonstrate our
approach on a drug optimization task for the human glucocorticoid receptor,
generating molecules with improved hydrophilicity while preserving key
interactions, under computational evaluations. These results highlight the
flexibility, robustness, and real-world utility of our method, opening new
avenues for molecule editing and optimization.

### [686] [LIFT the Veil for the Truth: Principal Weights Emerge after Rank Reduction for Reasoning-Focused Supervised Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00772)
*Zihang Liu,Tianyu Pang,Oleg Balabanov,Chaoqun Yang,Tianjin Huang,Lu Yin,Yaoqing Yang,Shiwei Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LIFT的低秩稀疏微调方法，仅更新5%的关键权重，在推理任务中表现优于全微调，同时保持高效内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全微调计算成本高且易过拟合，稀疏微调在LLM时代效果不佳，需找到关键权重以提高效率与效果。

Method: 通过低秩近似识别关键权重（Principal Weights），仅更新前5%的关键权重进行微调。

Result: LIFT在推理任务中表现优于全微调，内存效率高，且保留更多源领域知识。

Conclusion: LIFT是一种高效且有效的稀疏微调方法，适用于LLM的推理任务。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that supervised fine-tuning of LLMs on a small
number of high-quality datasets can yield strong reasoning capabilities.
However, full fine-tuning (Full FT), while powerful, is computationally
expensive and susceptible to overfitting and catastrophic forgetting,
particularly when data is limited. Sparse fine-tuning, which previously
achieved notable success by updating only a small subset of model parameters,
offers a promising trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. Yet, it has
lagged behind in the LLM era due to the difficulty of identifying parameters
truly critical for reasoning. In this work, we state that weights with the
largest magnitude after low-rank approximation are critical weights for
fine-tuning, which we call Principal Weights. Surprisingly, while
magnitude-based sparse fine-tuning performs poorly as a baseline on LLM
fine-tuning, it becomes highly effective after rank reduction. These insights
motivate our method: Low-rank Informed Sparse Fine-Tuning (LIFT). LIFT only
updates the top 5% Principal Weights throughout training and consistently
achieves better performance on reasoning tasks than Full FT, while maintaining
memory efficiency on par with popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.
In addition to strong performance on target domains such as arithmetic
reasoning, LIFT also retains up to 20% more source-domain knowledge, compared
to Full FT and LoRA. Our code is available at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归动作依赖策略在多智能体场景中计算复杂度高，限制了可扩展性。本文旨在提出一种更通用的动作依赖策略形式。

Method: 引入动作依赖图（ADG）建模智能体间动作依赖关系，提出基于ADG的表格策略迭代算法，并将其集成到现有SOTA算法中。

Result: 理论证明稀疏ADG策略在特定条件下可实现全局最优，实验验证了方法的鲁棒性和广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的ADG框架为MARL提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Action-dependent individual policies, which incorporate both environmental
states and the actions of other agents in decision-making, have emerged as a
promising paradigm for achieving global optimality in multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL). However, the existing literature often adopts auto-regressive
action-dependent policies, where each agent's policy depends on the actions of
all preceding agents. This formulation incurs substantial computational
complexity as the number of agents increases, thereby limiting scalability. In
this work, we consider a more generalized class of action-dependent policies,
which do not necessarily follow the auto-regressive form. We propose to use the
`action dependency graph (ADG)' to model the inter-agent action dependencies.
Within the context of MARL problems structured by coordination graphs, we prove
that an action-dependent policy with a sparse ADG can achieve global
optimality, provided the ADG satisfies specific conditions specified by the
coordination graph. Building on this theoretical foundation, we develop a
tabular policy iteration algorithm with guaranteed global optimality.
Furthermore, we integrate our framework into several SOTA algorithms and
conduct experiments in complex environments. The empirical results affirm the
robustness and applicability of our approach in more general scenarios,
underscoring its potential for broader MARL challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战现有图去学习方法假设被删除信息无法恢复的观点，揭示其隐私漏洞。

Method: 利用置信度陷阱和自适应预测机制，结合现有成员推理技术，设计TrendAttack。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上，TrendAttack显著优于现有GNN成员推理基线。

Conclusion: 当前图去学习方法存在严重隐私漏洞，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Graph unlearning methods aim to efficiently remove the impact of sensitive
data from trained GNNs without full retraining, assuming that deleted
information cannot be recovered. In this work, we challenge this assumption by
introducing the graph unlearning inversion attack: given only black-box access
to an unlearned GNN and partial graph knowledge, can an adversary reconstruct
the removed edges? We identify two key challenges: varying
probability-similarity thresholds for unlearned versus retained edges, and the
difficulty of locating unlearned edge endpoints, and address them with
TrendAttack. First, we derive and exploit the confidence pitfall, a theoretical
and empirical pattern showing that nodes adjacent to unlearned edges exhibit a
large drop in model confidence. Second, we design an adaptive prediction
mechanism that applies different similarity thresholds to unlearned and other
membership edges. Our framework flexibly integrates existing membership
inference techniques and extends them with trend features. Experiments on four
real-world datasets demonstrate that TrendAttack significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art GNN membership inference baselines, exposing a critical
privacy vulnerability in current graph unlearning methods.

Motivation: 传统语义熵（SE）在长句子生成中效果不佳，因为它忽略了簇内和簇间的相似性。

Method: 提出了一种基于最近邻熵估计的黑盒不确定性量化方法，并可扩展到白盒设置。

Result: 实验证明该方法在Phi3和Llama3模型上优于语义熵，适用于问答、摘要和机器翻译任务。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了语义熵的局限性，并在多种任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) can be detected by assessing
the uncertainty of model outputs, typically measured using entropy. Semantic
entropy (SE) enhances traditional entropy estimation by quantifying uncertainty
at the semantic cluster level. However, as modern LLMs generate longer
one-sentence responses, SE becomes less effective because it overlooks two
crucial factors: intra-cluster similarity (the spread within a cluster) and
inter-cluster similarity (the distance between clusters). To address these
limitations, we propose a simple black-box uncertainty quantification method
inspired by nearest neighbor estimates of entropy. Our approach can also be
easily extended to white-box settings by incorporating token probabilities.
Additionally, we provide theoretical results showing that our method
generalizes semantic entropy. Extensive empirical results demonstrate its
effectiveness compared to semantic entropy across two recent LLMs (Phi3 and
Llama3) and three common text generation tasks: question answering, text
summarization, and machine translation. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 未来研究方向包括结构化训练、鲁棒评估、特征级遗忘、更广泛的应用、可扩展方法和对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce machine unlearning for speech tasks, a novel and underexplored
research problem that aims to efficiently and effectively remove the influence
of specific data from trained speech models without full retraining. This has
important applications in privacy preservation, removal of outdated or noisy
data, and bias mitigation. While machine unlearning has been studied in
computer vision and natural language processing, its application to speech is
largely unexplored due to the high-dimensional, sequential, and
speaker-dependent nature of speech data. We define two fundamental speech
unlearning tasks: sample unlearning, which removes individual data points
(e.g., a voice recording), and class unlearning, which removes an entire
category (e.g., all data from a speaker), while preserving performance on the
remaining data. Experiments on keyword spotting and speaker identification
demonstrate that unlearning speech data is significantly more challenging than
unlearning image or text data. We conclude with key future directions in this
area, including structured training, robust evaluation, feature-level
unlearning, broader applications, scalable methods, and adversarial robustness.

Method: 使用Centered Kernel Alignment（CKA）分析预训练LLM的表示动态，识别关键层，并通过谱分析揭示其驱动因素。

Conclusion: 数据无关方法能有效识别LLM中的关键层，为高效微调和安全防御提供新途径。

Abstract: Understanding how feature representations evolve across layers in large
language models (LLMs) is key to improving their interpretability and
robustness. While recent studies have identified critical layers linked to
specific functions or behaviors, these efforts typically rely on data-dependent
analyses of fine-tuned models, limiting their use to post-hoc settings. In
contrast, we introduce a data-oblivious approach to identify intrinsic critical
layers in pre-fine-tuned LLMs by analyzing representation dynamics via Centered
Kernel Alignment(CKA). We show that layers with significant shifts in
representation space are also those most affected during fine-tuning--a pattern
that holds consistently across tasks for a given model. Our spectral analysis
further reveals that these shifts are driven by changes in the top principal
components, which encode semantic transitions from rationales to conclusions.
We further apply these findings to two practical scenarios: efficient domain
adaptation, where fine-tuning critical layers leads to greater loss reduction
compared to non-critical layers; and backdoor defense, where freezing them
reduces attack success rates by up to 40%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DMs和VAEs在实证中表现成功，但其泛化性能的理论研究不足，尤其是缺乏对共享编码器-生成器结构的全面考虑。

Method: 利用信息论工具，提出一个统一的理论框架，将编码器和生成器视为随机映射，分析其泛化性能。

Result: 框架改进了对VAEs的分析，揭示了DMs中泛化与扩散时间T的权衡关系，并提供了基于训练数据的可计算边界。

Conclusion: 实证结果验证了理论的合理性，框架为优化模型性能提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of Diffusion Models (DMs) and Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs), their generalization performance remains theoretically
underexplored, especially lacking a full consideration of the shared
encoder-generator structure. Leveraging recent information-theoretic tools, we
propose a unified theoretical framework that provides guarantees for the
generalization of both the encoder and generator by treating them as randomized
mappings. This framework further enables (1) a refined analysis for VAEs,
accounting for the generator's generalization, which was previously overlooked;
(2) illustrating an explicit trade-off in generalization terms for DMs that
depends on the diffusion time $T$; and (3) providing computable bounds for DMs
based solely on the training data, allowing the selection of the optimal $T$
and the integration of such bounds into the optimization process to improve
model performance. Empirical results on both synthetic and real datasets
illustrate the validity of the proposed theory.

TL;DR: FLoE是一种新型的PEFT框架，通过动态识别关键层和自动优化LoRA秩，显著提升了适配效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法在适配预训练大模型时，忽视了层间异质性和任务特定需求，导致参数冗余和效率低下。

Method: FLoE引入Fisher信息评分机制动态识别关键层，并结合贝叶斯优化自动分配LoRA秩。

Result: 实验表明，FLoE在多种LLM和基准测试中实现了高效的准确性与资源消耗平衡。

Conclusion: FLoE特别适用于资源受限且需要快速适配的场景。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a widely
adopted strategy for adapting pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to
downstream tasks, significantly reducing memory and computational costs.
However, most existing PEFT techniques uniformly deploy LoRA adapters across
all layers, disregarding the intrinsic heterogeneity of layer contributions and
task-specific rank requirements. This uniform paradigm leads to redundant
parameter allocation and suboptimal adaptation efficiency. To address these
limitations, we propose FLoE, a novel PEFT framework that introduces two key
innovations: (i) a Fisher information-guided importance scoring mechanism to
dynamically identify task-critical transformer layers for MoE-based low-rank
adaptation, enabling sparse adapter deployment; and (ii) a Bayesian
optimization-driven rank allocator that automatically determines optimal LoRA
ranks on specific datasets without exhaustive grid search. Extensive
experiments across diverse LLMs and benchmarks reveal that FLoE achieves
impressive efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, making FLoE particularly
advantageous in resource-constrained environments that necessitate rapid
adaptation.

Conclusion: LoMAP通过解决采样过程中的引导不准确问题，提高了扩散生成模型的可靠性，适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative modeling have demonstrated
significant promise in tackling long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks by leveraging
offline datasets. While these approaches have achieved promising results, their
reliability remains inconsistent due to the inherent stochastic risk of
producing infeasible trajectories, limiting their applicability in
safety-critical applications. We identify that the primary cause of these
failures is inaccurate guidance during the sampling procedure, and demonstrate
the existence of manifold deviation by deriving a lower bound on the guidance
gap. To address this challenge, we propose Local Manifold Approximation and
Projection (LoMAP), a training-free method that projects the guided sample onto
a low-rank subspace approximated from offline datasets, preventing infeasible
trajectory generation. We validate our approach on standard offline
reinforcement learning benchmarks that involve challenging long-horizon
planning. Furthermore, we show that, as a standalone module, LoMAP can be
incorporated into the hierarchical diffusion planner, providing further
performance enhancements.

Abstract: Molecular Relational Learning (MRL) aims to understand interactions between
molecular pairs, playing a critical role in advancing biochemical research.
With the recent development of large language models (LLMs), a growing number
of studies have explored the integration of MRL with LLMs and achieved
promising results. However, the increasing availability of diverse LLMs and
molecular structure encoders has significantly expanded the model space,
presenting major challenges for benchmarking. Currently, there is no LLM
framework that supports both flexible molecular input formats and dynamic
architectural switching. To address these challenges, reduce redundant coding,
and ensure fair model comparison, we propose ModuLM, a framework designed to
support flexible LLM-based model construction and diverse molecular
representations. ModuLM provides a rich suite of modular components, including
8 types of 2D molecular graph encoders, 11 types of 3D molecular conformation
encoders, 7 types of interaction layers, and 7 mainstream LLM backbones. Owing
to its highly flexible model assembly mechanism, ModuLM enables the dynamic
construction of over 50,000 distinct model configurations. In addition, we
provide comprehensive results to demonstrate the effectiveness of ModuLM in

Motivation: 扩散模型在离线强化学习中受限于训练数据的质量和多样性，难以泛化到训练分布之外的任务或长规划范围。

Method: SCoTS方法首先学习一个保留时间距离的潜在表示，然后通过方向性探索和新颖性引导迭代拼接轨迹段，扩展潜在空间。

Result: 实验表明，SCoTS显著提升了扩散模型在离线目标条件基准测试中的性能和泛化能力，同时改善了其他离线强化学习算法的表现。

Conclusion: SCoTS通过轨迹拼接有效解决了扩散模型在数据质量和多样性上的限制，为离线强化学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models are emerging as powerful tools for
long-horizon planning in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly with offline
datasets. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality
and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to
tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To
overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching
(SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally
stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse
and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving
latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the
environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by
directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent
space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and
generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned
benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore,
augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance
of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse
environments.

Result: 在11个数据集上评估，PCoreSet优于现有选择方法。

Conclusion: ActiveKD推动了主动学习与知识蒸馏的结合研究，PCoreSet策略在有限标注下表现优异。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used framework for training compact,
task-specific models by leveraging the knowledge of teacher models. However,
its application to active learning (AL), which aims to minimize annotation
costs through iterative sample selection, remains underexplored. This gap stems
from the fact that KD typically assumes access to sufficient labeled data,
whereas AL operates in data-scarce scenarios where task-specific teacher models
are often unavailable. In this paper, we introduce ActiveKD, a framework that
integrates AL with KD by leveraging the zero- and few-shot capabilities of
large vision-language models (VLMs). A key aspect of ActiveKD is the structured
prediction bias of VLMs--i.e., their predictions form clusters in the
probability space. We regard this structure as an inductive bias of the teacher
model, capturing generalizable output patterns beneficial to student learning.
To exploit this bias, we propose Probabilistic CoreSet (PCoreSet), a selection
strategy that maximizes coverage in the probability space rather than the
feature space. PCoreSet strategically selects categorically diverse unlabeled
samples, facilitating more efficient transfer of teacher knowledge under
limited annotation budgets. Evaluations on 11 datasets show that PCoreSet
consistently outperforms existing selection methods within the ActiveKD
framework, advancing research at the intersection of AL and KD.

Conclusion: RL能有效提升泛化能力，但组合性和可解释性仍是挑战。

Abstract: Previous research has sought to enhance the graph reasoning capabilities of
LLMs by supervised fine-tuning on synthetic graph data. While these led to
specialized LLMs better at solving graph algorithm problems, we don't need LLMs
for shortest path: we need generalization from synthetic graph data to
real-world tasks with implicit graph structures. In this work, we propose to
unlock generalizable learning of graph synthetic data with reinforcement
learning. We first design solution-based and process-based rewards for
synthetic graph problems: instead of rigid memorizing response patterns in
direct fine-tuning, we posit that RL would help LLMs grasp the essentials
underlying graph reasoning and alleviate overfitting. We employ RL algorithms
such as GRPO and DPO, aligning both off-the-shelf LLMs and LLMs fine-tuned on
synthetic graph data. We then compare them against existing settings on both
in-domain synthetic tasks and out-of-domain real-world tasks with implicit
graph structures such as multi-hop QA, structured planning, and more. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our RL recipe leads to statistically significant
improvement on 5 datasets, with an average gain of 12.9\% over baseline
settings. Further analysis reveals that process-based rewards consistently
outperform solution-based rewards, mixing synthetic and real-world task data
yields potential gains, while compositionality and explainable intermediate
steps remains a critical challenge even after RL.

Conclusion: 该方法在不依赖基础模型预测的情况下，有效估计输入依赖性不确定性，并在多个基准测试中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is critical in safety-sensitive applications but
is often omitted from off-the-shelf neural networks due to adverse effects on
predictive performance. Retrofitting uncertainty estimates post-hoc typically
requires access to model parameters or gradients, limiting feasibility in
practice. We propose a theoretically grounded framework for post-hoc
uncertainty estimation in regression tasks by fitting an auxiliary model to
both original inputs and frozen model outputs. Drawing from principles of
maximum likelihood estimation and sequential parameter fitting, we formalize an
exact post-hoc optimization objective that recovers the canonical MLE of
Gaussian parameters, without requiring sampling or approximation at inference.
While prior work has used model outputs to estimate uncertainty, we explicitly
characterize the conditions under which this is valid and demonstrate the
extent to which structured outputs can support quasi-epistemic inference. We
find that using diverse auxiliary data, such as augmented subsets of the
original training data, significantly enhances OOD detection and metric
performance. Our hypothesis that frozen model outputs contain generalizable
latent information about model error and predictive uncertainty is tested and
confirmed. Finally, we ensure that our method maintains proper estimation of
input-dependent uncertainty without relying exclusively on base model
forecasts. These findings are demonstrated in toy problems and adapted to both

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM是一种新型的位置编码机制，使Transformer模型能够在其训练长度的10倍范围内准确推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度序列模型在测试序列长度显著超过训练长度时准确性下降的问题，尤其是在算法推理、多步算术和组合泛化等关键任务中。

Method: PRISM通过可微分直方图滤波更新学习连续相对位置，使用概率叠加而非确定性嵌入来保持位置不确定性。

Result: PRISM在算法基准测试中实现了最先进的长度推断能力，包括算术、SCAN组合任务和复杂复制变体。

Conclusion: PRISM的随机位置编码提供了可靠长度泛化的理论基础，推动了神经序列模型在远超训练长度时仍保持算法鲁棒性的目标。

Abstract: Deep sequence models typically degrade in accuracy when test sequences
significantly exceed their training lengths, yet many critical tasks--such as
algorithmic reasoning, multi-step arithmetic, and compositional
generalization--require robust length extrapolation. We introduce PRISM, a
Probabilistic Relative-position Implicit Superposition Model, a novel
positional encoding mechanism that enables Transformers to extrapolate
accurately up to 10x beyond their training length. PRISM learns continuous
relative positions through a differentiable histogram-filter update, preserving
position uncertainty via a probabilistic superposition rather than conventional
deterministic embeddings. Empirically, PRISM achieves state-of-the-art length
extrapolation, successfully generalizing to previously intractable sequence
lengths across algorithmic benchmarks--including arithmetic (addition,
multiplication), SCAN compositionality tasks, and complex copy variants derived
from DeepMind's recent datasets. Our analysis demonstrates that PRISM's
stochastic positional encoding maintains sharp and interpretable internal
states, providing a theoretical basis for reliable length generalization. These
results advance the goal of neural sequence models that remain algorithmically
robust at lengths far exceeding their training horizon.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of molecular metabolic stability (MS) is critical for
drug research and development but remains challenging due to the complex
interplay of molecular interactions. Despite recent advances in graph neural
networks (GNNs) for MS prediction, current approaches face two critical
limitations: (1) incomplete molecular modeling due to atom-centric
message-passing mechanisms that disregard bond-level topological features, and
(2) prediction frameworks that lack reliable uncertainty quantification. To
address these challenges, we propose TrustworthyMS, a novel contrastive
learning framework designed for uncertainty-aware metabolic stability
prediction. First, a molecular graph topology remapping mechanism synchronizes
atom-bond interactions through edge-induced feature propagation, capturing both
localized electronic effects and global conformational constraints. Second,
contrastive topology-bond alignment enforces consistency between molecular
topology views and bond patterns via feature alignment, enhancing
representation robustness. Third, uncertainty modeling through Beta-Binomial
uncertainty quantification enables simultaneous prediction and confidence
calibration under epistemic uncertainty. Through extensive experiments, our
results demonstrate that TrustworthyMS outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods in terms of predictive performance.

Abstract: Data heterogeneity plays a pivotal role in determining the performance of
machine learning (ML) systems. Traditional algorithms, which are typically
designed to optimize average performance, often overlook the intrinsic
diversity within datasets. This oversight can lead to a myriad of issues,
including unreliable decision-making, inadequate generalization across
different domains, unfair outcomes, and false scientific inferences. Hence, a
nuanced approach to modeling data heterogeneity is essential for the
development of dependable, data-driven systems. In this survey paper, we
present a thorough exploration of heterogeneity-aware machine learning, a
paradigm that systematically integrates considerations of data heterogeneity
throughout the entire ML pipeline -- from data collection and model training to
model evaluation and deployment. By applying this approach to a variety of
critical fields, including healthcare, agriculture, finance, and recommendation
systems, we demonstrate the substantial benefits and potential of
heterogeneity-aware ML. These applications underscore how a deeper
understanding of data diversity can enhance model robustness, fairness, and
reliability and help model diagnosis and improvements. Moreover, we delve into
future directions and provide research opportunities for the whole data mining
community, aiming to promote the development of heterogeneity-aware ML.

TL;DR: 研究发现，Transformer架构中的自注意力机制并非其性能提升的唯一关键因素，随机固定注意力的简化模型MixiT在某些任务中表现与完整Transformer相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Transformer架构中自注意力机制对性能提升的具体贡献，以及不同组件在任务中的作用。

Method: 通过冻结MLP层或注意力投影器，并引入随机固定注意力的MixiT模型，对比标准Transformer的性能。

Result: MixiT在算术和记忆任务中表现与完整Transformer相当，但在检索任务中表现较差；冻结查询和键投影器的注意力仍能形成关键电路并胜任语言建模。

Conclusion: 架构的异构性（不同组件的互补性）对解决不同任务至关重要。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture is central to the success of modern Large
Language Models (LLMs), in part due to its surprising ability to perform a wide
range of algorithmic tasks -- including mathematical reasoning, memorization,
and retrieval -- using only gradient-based training on next-token prediction.
While the core component of a Transformer is the self-attention mechanism, we
question how much, and which aspects, of the performance gains can be
attributed to it. To this end, we compare standard Transformers to variants in
which either the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers or the attention
projectors (queries and keys) are frozen at initialization. To further isolate
the contribution of attention, we introduce MixiT -- the Mixing Transformer --
a simplified, principled model in which the attention coefficients are entirely
random and fixed at initialization, eliminating any input-dependent computation
or learning in attention. Surprisingly, we find that MixiT matches the
performance of fully trained Transformers on various algorithmic tasks,
especially those involving basic arithmetic or focusing heavily on
memorization. For retrieval-based tasks, we observe that having input-dependent
attention coefficients is consistently beneficial, while MixiT underperforms.
We attribute this failure to its inability to form specialized circuits such as
induction heads -- a specific circuit known to be crucial for learning and
exploiting repeating patterns in input sequences. Even more interestingly, we
find that attention with frozen key and query projectors is not only able to
form induction heads, but can also perform competitively on language modeling.
Our results underscore the importance of architectural heterogeneity, where
distinct components contribute complementary inductive biases crucial for
solving different classes of tasks.

TL;DR: ZapFormat是一种基于Earley算法的动态剪枝策略，显著减少内存占用，提升解码速度。Formatron引擎结合ZapFormat和其他优化，在结构化生成任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保LLM输出符合严格的结构或语法约束（如函数调用和DSL生成）仍具挑战性，现有约束解码引擎存在显著开销。

Method: 提出ZapFormat，基于Earley算法动态剪枝无效或冗余状态，结合状态缓存加速解码。

Result: Formatron在JSON生成、JSON Schema验证等任务中保持高精度，推理速度提升高达2倍。

Conclusion: Formatron通用性强，适用于多种LLM架构，已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, yet ensuring
their outputs conform to strict structural or grammatical constraints remains
challenging, which is critical in function calls and domain-specific language
(DSL) generation. Constrained decoding with context-free grammar is a flexible
approach to guarantee LLMs' adherence to a specific format by dynamically
building a token logits mask. However, creating this mask requires checking the
validity of all tokens in the LLM vocabulary at every decoding step, which
often incurs significant overheads in existing constrained decoding engines. To
address this challenge, we propose $\textbf{ZapFormat}$, a novel
$\textbf{dynamic pruning}$ strategy based on the Earley algorithm that
identifies and eliminates invalid or redundant Earley states in real-time,
significantly reducing memory occupation of the Earley algorithm's states. This
further enables us to use a state cache to speed up structured generations on a
large number of queries. We implemented ZapFormat in a new constrained decoding
engine called Formatron which also incorporates existing optimizations. Through
comprehensive experiments on structured generation tasks, including JSON
generation, JSON Schema validation, and semantic parsing, we demonstrate that
Formatron not only $\textbf{consistently maintains}$ high-precision compliant
outputs but also achieves $\textbf{significant improvements}$ in inference
speed up to 2x compared to state-of-the-art implementations. More importantly,
Formatron is generally applicable across various LLM architectures. We release
Formatron as open source at https://github.com/Dan-wanna-M/formatron.

TL;DR: SGG是一种优化器包装方法，通过动态分组和组特定缩放改进自适应学习率估计，提升LLM训练的稳定性和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型（LLM）训练中存在梯度变化和学习率估计效率低的问题，导致训练不稳定、收敛慢，且与参数高效微调（PEFT）技术兼容性差。

Method: SGG通过动态分组梯度统计信息并为每组应用特定缩放，校准每个参数的学习率，同时保持精确的逐参数适应。

Result: 实验表明，SGG与现有优化器无缝集成，在不同模型规模下均能提供稳定的性能提升和更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: SGG因其在不同批量大小和学习率下的稳定性，成为LLM优化的可靠选择。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) poses challenges due to their massive
scale and heterogeneous architectures. While adaptive optimizers like AdamW
help address gradient variations, they still struggle with efficient and
effective parameter-wise learning rate estimation, resulting in training
instability, slow convergence, and poor compatibility with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques. This work introduces Scaling with Gradient
Grouping (SGG), an optimizer wrapper that improves adaptive learning rate
estimation by dynamic grouping and group-specific scaling. SGG first groups
gradient statistics in each layer into clusters and then applies
cluster-specific scaling to calibrate learning rates for each parameter, thus
imposing collective group-wise constraints while maintaining precise
per-parameter adaptation. Experiments on diverse (M)LLM benchmarks show that
SGG integrates seamlessly with existing optimizers, and offers consistent gains
and faster convergence over baselines, with various model sizes. Its stability
across varying batch sizes and learning rates establishes SGG as a robust
choice for LLM optimization.

Conclusion: XAI-Units为特征归因方法的评估提供了可靠工具，支持系统化实验。

Abstract: Feature attribution (FA) methods are widely used in explainable AI (XAI) to
help users understand how the inputs of a machine learning model contribute to
its outputs. However, different FA models often provide disagreeing importance
scores for the same model. In the absence of ground truth or in-depth knowledge
about the inner workings of the model, it is often difficult to meaningfully
determine which of the different FA methods produce more suitable explanations
in different contexts. As a step towards addressing this issue, we introduce
the open-source XAI-Units benchmark, specifically designed to evaluate FA
methods against diverse types of model behaviours, such as feature
interactions, cancellations, and discontinuous outputs. Our benchmark provides
a set of paired datasets and models with known internal mechanisms,
establishing clear expectations for desirable attribution scores. Accompanied
by a suite of built-in evaluation metrics, XAI-Units streamlines systematic
experimentation and reveals how FA methods perform against distinct, atomic
kinds of model reasoning, similar to unit tests in software engineering.
Crucially, by using procedurally generated models tied to synthetic datasets,
we pave the way towards an objective and reliable comparison of FA methods.

Conclusion: 研究表明，统一的缩放框架可用于预测压缩表示下的模型性能，并为稀疏-量化格式的训练提供了改进算法。

Abstract: Scaling laws have shaped recent advances in machine learning by enabling
predictable scaling of model performance based on model size, computation, and
data volume. Concurrently, the rise in computational cost for AI has motivated
model compression techniques, notably quantization and sparsification, which
have emerged to mitigate the steep computational demands associated with
large-scale training and inference. This paper investigates the interplay
between scaling laws and compression formats, exploring whether a unified
scaling framework can accurately predict model performance when training occurs
over various compressed representations, such as sparse, scalar-quantized,
sparse-quantized or even vector-quantized formats. Our key contributions
include validating a general scaling law formulation and showing that it is
applicable both individually but also composably across compression types.
Based on this, our main finding is demonstrating both theoretically and
empirically that there exists a simple "capacity" metric -- based on the
representation's ability to fit random Gaussian data -- which can robustly
predict parameter efficiency across multiple compressed representations. On the
practical side, we extend our formulation to directly compare the accuracy
potential of different compressed formats, and to derive better algorithms for
training over sparse-quantized formats.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Uncertainty Estimation (UE) methods have become a
crucial tool for detecting hallucinations in recent years. While numerous UE
methods have been proposed, most existing studies evaluate them in isolated
short-form QA settings using threshold-independent metrics such as AUROC or
PRR. However, real-world deployment of UE methods introduces several
challenges. In this work, we systematically examine four key aspects of
deploying UE methods in practical settings. Specifically, we assess (1) the
sensitivity of UE methods to decision threshold selection, (2) their robustness
to query transformations such as typos, adversarial prompts, and prior chat
history, (3) their applicability to long-form generation, and (4) strategies
for handling multiple UE scores for a single query. Our evaluations on 19 UE
methods reveal that most of them are highly sensitive to threshold selection
when there is a distribution shift in the calibration dataset. While these
methods generally exhibit robustness against previous chat history and typos,
they are significantly vulnerable to adversarial prompts. Additionally, while
existing UE methods can be adapted for long-form generation through various
strategies, there remains considerable room for improvement. Lastly, ensembling
multiple UE scores at test time provides a notable performance boost, which
highlights its potential as a practical improvement strategy. Code is available

Abstract: Despite the remarkable generative capabilities of diffusion models, their
integration into safety-critical or scientifically rigorous applications
remains hindered by the need to ensure compliance with stringent physical,
structural, and operational constraints. To address this challenge, this paper
introduces Neuro-Symbolic Diffusion (NSD), a novel framework that interleaves
diffusion steps with symbolic optimization, enabling the generation of
certifiably consistent samples under user-defined functional and logic
constraints. This key feature is provided for both standard and discrete
diffusion models, enabling, for the first time, the generation of both
continuous (e.g., images and trajectories) and discrete (e.g., molecular
structures and natural language) outputs that comply with constraints. This
ability is demonstrated on tasks spanning three key challenges: (1) Safety, in
the context of non-toxic molecular generation and collision-free trajectory
optimization; (2) Data scarcity, in domains such as drug discovery and
materials engineering; and (3) Out-of-domain generalization, where enforcing
symbolic constraints allows adaptation beyond the training distribution.

Abstract: Simulation-free training frameworks have been at the forefront of the
generative modelling revolution in continuous spaces, leading to neural
dynamical systems that encompass modern large-scale diffusion and flow matching
models. Despite the scalability of training, the generation of high-quality
samples and their corresponding likelihood under the model requires expensive
numerical simulation -- inhibiting adoption in numerous scientific applications
such as equilibrium sampling of molecular systems. In this paper, we revisit
classical normalizing flows as one-step generative models with exact
likelihoods and propose a novel, scalable training objective that does not
require computing the expensive change of variable formula used in conventional
maximum likelihood training. We propose Forward-Only Regression Training
(FORT), a simple $\ell_2$-regression objective that maps prior samples under
our flow to specifically chosen targets. We demonstrate that FORT supports a
wide class of targets, such as optimal transport targets and targets from
pre-trained continuous-time normalizing flows (CNF). We further demonstrate
that by using CNF targets, our one-step flows allow for larger-scale training
that exceeds the performance and stability of maximum likelihood training,
while unlocking a broader class of architectures that were previously
challenging to train. Empirically, we elucidate that our trained flows can
perform equilibrium conformation sampling in Cartesian coordinates of alanine
dipeptide, alanine tripeptide, and alanine tetrapeptide.

(BO-QGAN) significantly improves performance, achieving a 2.27-fold higher Drug
Candidate Score (DCS) than prior quantum-hybrid benchmarks and 2.21-fold higher
than the classical baseline, using over 60% fewer parameters. Key findings
favor layering multiple (3-4) shallow (4-8 qubit) quantum circuits
sequentially, while classical architecture shows less sensitivity above a

Abstract: This paper studies reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for
aligning large language models with human preferences. While RLHF has
demonstrated promising results, many algorithms are highly sensitive to
misspecifications in the underlying preference model (e.g., the Bradley-Terry
model), the reference policy, or the reward function, resulting in undesirable
fine-tuning. To address model misspecification, we propose a doubly robust
preference optimization algorithm that remains consistent when either the
preference model or the reference policy is correctly specified (without
requiring both). Our proposal demonstrates superior and more robust performance
than state-of-the-art algorithms, both in theory and in practice. The code is

Conclusion: GC和UGAS方法有效解决了权重耦合问题和图神经架构搜索的局限性，实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: To address the weight coupling problem, certain studies introduced few-shot
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods, which partition the supernet into
multiple sub-supernets. However, these methods often suffer from computational
inefficiency and tend to provide suboptimal partitioning schemes. To address
this problem more effectively, we analyze the weight coupling problem from a
novel perspective, which primarily stems from distinct modules in succeeding
layers imposing conflicting gradient directions on the preceding layer modules.
Based on this perspective, we propose the Gradient Contribution (GC) method
that efficiently computes the cosine similarity of gradient directions among
modules by decomposing the Vector-Jacobian Product during supernet
backpropagation. Subsequently, the modules with conflicting gradient directions
are allocated to distinct sub-supernets while similar ones are grouped
together. To assess the advantages of GC and address the limitations of
existing Graph Neural Architecture Search methods, which are limited to
searching a single type of Graph Neural Networks (Message Passing Neural
Networks (MPNNs) or Graph Transformers (GTs)), we propose the Unified Graph
Neural Architecture Search (UGAS) framework, which explores optimal
combinations of MPNNs and GTs. The experimental results demonstrate that GC
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in supernet partitioning quality
and time efficiency. In addition, the architectures searched by UGAS+GC
outperform both the manually designed GNNs and those obtained by existing NAS
methods. Finally, ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of all

TL;DR: TSRating是一个统一框架，利用LLMs的知识评估多领域时间序列数据质量，通过元学习和signSGD优化，在准确性和适应性上优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法局限于单一领域，难以准确评估跨领域时间序列数据质量，因此需要一种统一且高效的评级框架。

Method: 提出TSRating框架，利用LLMs的知识生成质量比较，并通过元学习训练TSRater模型，使用signSGD优化计算效率。

Result: 在11个基准数据集和3个时间序列任务中，TSRating在准确性、效率和跨领域适应性上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: TSRating通过结合LLMs和元学习，提供了一种高效且通用的时间序列数据质量评估方法。

Abstract: High-quality time series (TS) data are essential for ensuring TS model
performance, rendering research on rating TS data quality indispensable.
Existing methods have shown promising rating accuracy within individual
domains, primarily by extending data quality rating techniques such as
influence functions and Shapley values to account for temporal characteristics.
However, they neglect the fact that real-world TS data can span vastly
different domains and exhibit distinct properties, hampering the accurate and
efficient rating of diverse TS data. In this paper, we propose TSRating, a
novel and unified framework for rating the quality of time series data crawled
from diverse domains. TSRating is built on the assumption that LLMs inherit
ample knowledge, acquired during their extensive pretraining, enabling them to
comprehend and discern quality differences in diverse TS data. We verify this
assumption by devising a series of prompts to elicit quality comparisons from
LLMs for pairs of TS samples. We then fit a dedicated rating model, termed
TSRater, to convert the LLMs' judgments into efficient quality predictions via
TSRater's inference on future TS samples. To ensure cross-domain adaptability,
we develop a meta-learning scheme to train TSRater on quality comparisons
collected from nine distinct domains. To improve training efficiency, we employ
signSGD for inner-loop updates, thus circumventing the demanding computation of
hypergradients. Extensive experimental results on eleven benchmark datasets
across three time series tasks, each using both conventional TS models and TS
foundation models, demonstrate that TSRating outperforms baselines in terms of
estimation accuracy, efficiency, and domain adaptability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T-SHIRT是一种新颖的数据选择框架，通过引入新的评分方法，仅包含信息丰富的令牌进行质量评估，并选择具有高一致性的样本，显著提升了指令调优的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法在样本级别评估质量，忽略了令牌级别的信息量，且评分方法缺乏鲁棒性，容易因表面词汇特征而误选样本。

Method: 提出T-SHIRT框架，结合令牌级信息评估和样本邻域一致性，选择高质量数据。

Result: 使用T-SHIRT筛选的数据集（仅为原始数据的5%）训练的模型在八个基准测试中平均优于全数据集训练的模型5.48分。

Conclusion: T-SHIRT在多种LLM和数据集规模下均优于现有方法，且成本低、效率高。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to
effectively follow user instructions. To improve training efficiency and reduce
data redundancy, recent works use LLM-based scoring functions, e.g.,
Instruction-Following Difficulty (IFD), to select high-quality
instruction-tuning data with scores above a threshold. While these data
selection methods often lead to models that can match or even exceed the
performance of models trained on the full datasets, we identify two key
limitations: (i) they assess quality at the sample level, ignoring token-level
informativeness; and (ii) they overlook the robustness of the scoring method,
often selecting a sample due to superficial lexical features instead of its
true quality. In this work, we propose Token-Selective HIeRarchical Data
Selection for Instruction Tuning (T-SHIRT), a novel data selection framework
that introduces a new scoring method to include only informative tokens in
quality evaluation and also promotes robust and reliable samples whose
neighbors also show high quality with less local inconsistencies. We
demonstrate that models instruction-tuned on a curated dataset (only 5% of the
original size) using T-SHIRT can outperform those trained on the entire
large-scale dataset by up to 5.48 points on average across eight benchmarks.
Across various LLMs and training set scales, our method consistently surpasses
existing state-of-the-art data selection techniques, while also remaining both
cost-effective and highly efficient. For instance, by using GPT-2 for score
computation, we are able to process a dataset of 52k samples using 40 minutes
on a single GPU.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Spotter的方法，解决了机器遗忘中的两个盲点：过度遗忘和事后重新学习攻击。通过结合掩码知识蒸馏和类内分散损失，Spotter显著减少了过度遗忘并阻止了重新学习攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘技术忽视了过度遗忘和重新学习攻击的问题，导致模型性能下降或遗忘知识被恢复。

Method: 提出Spotter方法，结合掩码知识蒸馏惩罚和类内分散损失，以减少过度遗忘并阻止重新学习攻击。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，Spotter将过度遗忘降低至基线的0.05倍以下，遗忘准确率降至0%，保留集准确率差异小于1%，并阻止了重新学习攻击。

Conclusion: Spotter是一种实用的解决方案，有效解决了机器遗忘中的盲点问题。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to expunge a designated forget set from a
trained model without costly retraining, yet the existing techniques overlook
two critical blind spots: "over-unlearning" that deteriorates retained data
near the forget set, and post-hoc "relearning" attacks that aim to resurrect
the forgotten knowledge. We first derive the over-unlearning metric
OU@{\epsilon}, which represents the collateral damage to the nearby region of
the forget set, where the over-unlearning mainly appears. Next, we expose an
unforeseen relearning threat on MU, i.e., the Prototypical Relearning Attack,
which exploits the per-class prototype of the forget class with just a few
samples, and easily restores the pre-unlearning performance. To counter both
blind spots, we introduce Spotter, a plug-and-play objective that combines (i)
a masked knowledge-distillation penalty on the nearby region of forget set to
suppress OU@{\epsilon}, and (ii) an intra-class dispersion loss that scatters
forget-class embeddings, neutralizing prototypical relearning attacks. On
CIFAR-10, as one of validations, Spotter reduces OU@{\epsilon}by below the
0.05X of the baseline, drives forget accuracy to 0%, preserves accuracy of the
retain set within 1% of difference with the original, and denies the
prototype-attack by keeping the forget set accuracy within <1%, without
accessing retained data. It confirms that Spotter is a practical remedy of the
unlearning's blind spots.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为STSA的新方法，通过空间-时间统计聚合解决FCIL中的异构数据问题，并降低了计算和通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FCIL方法无法避免异构数据导致的客户端漂移，且计算和通信开销大，限制了实际应用。

Method: STSA通过空间（跨客户端）和时间（跨阶段）聚合特征统计量，避免异构数据影响，并以闭式更新分类器。STSA-E是其通信高效变体。

Result: 在三个FCIL数据集上的实验表明，STSA在性能、灵活性及通信计算效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STSA为FCIL提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案，显著提升了性能并降低了开销。

Abstract: Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL) enables Class-Incremental
Learning (CIL) from distributed data. Existing FCIL methods typically integrate
old knowledge preservation into local client training. However, these methods
cannot avoid spatial-temporal client drift caused by data heterogeneity and
often incur significant computational and communication overhead, limiting
practical deployment. To address these challenges simultaneously, we propose a
novel approach, Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation (STSA), which provides
a unified framework to aggregate feature statistics both spatially (across
clients) and temporally (across stages). The aggregated feature statistics are
unaffected by data heterogeneity and can be used to update the classifier in
closed form at each stage. Additionally, we introduce STSA-E, a
communication-efficient variant with theoretical guarantees, achieving similar
performance to STSA-E with much lower communication overhead. Extensive
experiments on three widely used FCIL datasets, with varying degrees of data
heterogeneity, show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art FCIL methods
in terms of performance, flexibility, and both communication and computation
efficiency.

Motivation: 传统扩散模型初始噪声缺乏结构和外部控制机制，现有方法多为确定性或启发式，表达力不足且难以扩展。

Result: 实验表明NoiseAR能生成高质量初始噪声，提升样本质量和条件一致性，并支持概率框架集成。

Conclusion: NoiseAR为扩散模型提供了一种动态可控的初始化方法，优于传统随机初始化，适用于复杂优化框架。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative frameworks, creating
data samples by progressively denoising an initial random state. Traditionally,
this initial state is sampled from a simple, fixed distribution like isotropic
Gaussian, inherently lacking structure and a direct mechanism for external
control. While recent efforts have explored ways to introduce controllability
into the diffusion process, particularly at the initialization stage, they
often rely on deterministic or heuristic approaches. These methods can be
suboptimal, lack expressiveness, and are difficult to scale or integrate into
more sophisticated optimization frameworks. In this paper, we introduce
NoiseAR, a novel method for AutoRegressive Initial Noise Prior for Diffusion
Models. Instead of a static, unstructured source, NoiseAR learns to generate a
dynamic and controllable prior distribution for the initial noise. We formulate
the generation of the initial noise prior's parameters as an autoregressive
probabilistic modeling task over spatial patches or tokens. This approach
enables NoiseAR to capture complex spatial dependencies and introduce learned
structure into the initial state. Crucially, NoiseAR is designed to be
conditional, allowing text prompts to directly influence the learned prior,
thereby achieving fine-grained control over the diffusion initialization. Our
experiments demonstrate that NoiseAR can generate initial noise priors that
lead to improved sample quality and enhanced consistency with conditional
inputs, offering a powerful, learned alternative to traditional random
initialization. A key advantage of NoiseAR is its probabilistic formulation,
which naturally supports seamless integration into probabilistic frameworks
like Markov Decision Processes and Reinforcement Learning. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/HKUST-SAIL/NoiseAR/

Abstract: Spatio-temporal deep learning models aims to utilize useful patterns in such
data to support tasks like prediction. However, previous deep learning models
designed for specific tasks typically require separate training for each use
case, leading to increased computational and storage costs. To address this
issue, spatio-temporal foundation models have emerged, offering a unified
framework capable of solving multiple spatio-temporal tasks. These foundation
models achieve remarkable success by learning general knowledge with
spatio-temporal data or transferring the general capabilities of pre-trained
language models. While previous surveys have explored spatio-temporal data and
methodologies separately, they have ignored a comprehensive examination of how
foundation models are designed, selected, pre-trained, and adapted. As a
result, the overall pipeline for spatio-temporal foundation models remains
unclear. To bridge this gap, we innovatively provide an up-to-date review of
previous spatio-temporal foundation models from the pipeline perspective. The
pipeline begins with an introduction to different types of spatio-temporal
data, followed by details of data preprocessing and embedding techniques. The
pipeline then presents a novel data property taxonomy to divide existing
methods according to data sources and dependencies, providing efficient and
effective model design and selection for researchers. On this basis, we further
illustrate the training objectives of primitive models, as well as the
adaptation techniques of transferred models. Overall, our survey provides a
clear and structured pipeline to understand the connection between core
elements of spatio-temporal foundation models while guiding researchers to get
started quickly. Additionally, we introduce emerging opportunities such as
multi-objective training in the field of spatio-temporal foundation models.

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，模型不仅提升了后训练性能，还能有效实现测试时扩展。

Conclusion: 自验证框架解决了分布差异问题，显著提升了模型性能，且无需依赖外部验证器。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in complex
reasoning tasks through both post-training and test-time scaling laws. While
prevalent test-time scaling approaches are often realized by using external
reward models to guide the model generation process, we find only marginal
gains can be acquired when scaling a model post-trained on specific reasoning
tasks. We identify that the limited improvement stems from distribution
discrepancies between the specific post-trained generator and the general
reward model. To address this, we propose a framework that incentivizes LLMs to
self-verify their own answers. By unifying answer generation and verification
within a single reinforcement learning (RL) process, we train models that can
effectively assess the correctness of their own solutions. The trained model
can further scale its performance during inference time by verifying its
generations, without the need for external verifiers. We train our
self-verification models based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, demonstrating its capabilities across varying
reasoning context lengths. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning
benchmarks show that our models can not only improve post-training performance
but also enable effective test-time scaling. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模模型服务的高成本阻碍了其普及和创新，现有编译器优化方法在神经网络任务中效率低下，随机搜索技术样本效率不足且缺乏上下文感知。

Method: 提出REASONING COMPILER框架，将优化问题建模为上下文感知的序列决策过程，结合LLM生成硬件感知的优化建议，并通过MCTS平衡探索与利用。

Result: 该方法在显著减少样本量的情况下实现了性能提升，优于现有神经编译器。

Conclusion: LLM引导的推理方法有望改变编译器优化的格局，为高效模型服务提供新思路。

Abstract: While model serving has unlocked unprecedented capabilities, the high cost of
serving large-scale models continues to be a significant barrier to widespread
accessibility and rapid innovation. Compiler optimizations have long driven
substantial performance improvements, but existing compilers struggle with
neural workloads due to the exponentially large and highly interdependent space
of possible transformations. Although existing stochastic search techniques can
be effective, they are often sample-inefficient and fail to leverage the
structural context underlying compilation decisions. We set out to investigate
the research question of whether reasoning with large language models (LLMs),
without any retraining, can leverage the context-aware decision space of
compiler optimization to significantly improve sample efficiency. To that end,
we introduce a novel compilation framework (dubbed REASONING COMPILER) that
formulates optimization as a sequential, context-aware decision process, guided
by a large language model and structured Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The
LLM acts as a proposal mechanism, suggesting hardware-aware transformations
that reflect the current program state and accumulated performance feedback.
Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) incorporates the LLM-generated proposals to
balance exploration and exploitation, facilitating structured,
context-sensitive traversal of the expansive compiler optimization space. By
achieving substantial speedups with markedly fewer samples than leading neural
compilers, our approach demonstrates the potential of LLM-guided reasoning to
transform the landscape of compiler optimization.

Motivation: 工业物联网环境中，传统异常检测解释方法忽视时间结构，导致解释不精确或不可操作。

Method: 提出ShaTS方法，采用先验特征分组策略，保留时间依赖性，生成更精确的Shapley值解释。

Result: 在SWaT数据集上，ShaTS能准确识别关键时间点、受影响的传感器和执行器，且在解释性和资源效率上优于SHAP。

Conclusion: ShaTS满足工业环境的实时需求，提供了更精确和可操作的异常检测解释。

Abstract: Industrial Internet of Things environments increasingly rely on advanced
Anomaly Detection and explanation techniques to rapidly detect and mitigate
cyberincidents, thereby ensuring operational safety. The sequential nature of
data collected from these environments has enabled improvements in Anomaly
Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models by processing time
windows rather than treating the data as tabular. However, conventional
explanation methods often neglect this temporal structure, leading to imprecise
or less actionable explanations. This work presents ShaTS (Shapley values for
Time Series models), which is a model-agnostic explainable Artificial
Intelligence method designed to enhance the precision of Shapley value
explanations for time series models. ShaTS addresses the shortcomings of
traditional approaches by incorporating an a priori feature grouping strategy
that preserves temporal dependencies and produces both coherent and actionable
insights. Experiments conducted on the SWaT dataset demonstrate that ShaTS
accurately identifies critical time instants, precisely pinpoints the sensors,
actuators, and processes affected by anomalies, and outperforms SHAP in terms
of both explainability and resource efficiency, fulfilling the real-time
requirements of industrial environments.

Abstract: Stage lighting plays an essential role in live music performances,
influencing the engaging experience of both musicians and audiences. Given the
high costs associated with hiring or training professional lighting engineers,
Automatic Stage Lighting Control (ASLC) has gained increasing attention.
However, most existing approaches only classify music into limited categories
and map them to predefined light patterns, resulting in formulaic and
monotonous outcomes that lack rationality. To address this issue, this paper
presents an end-to-end solution that directly learns from experienced lighting
engineers -- Skip-BART. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
conceptualize ASLC as a generative task rather than merely a classification
problem. Our method modifies the BART model to take audio music as input and
produce light hue and value (intensity) as output, incorporating a novel skip
connection mechanism to enhance the relationship between music and light within
the frame grid.We validate our method through both quantitative analysis and an
human evaluation, demonstrating that Skip-BART outperforms conventional
rule-based methods across all evaluation metrics and shows only a limited gap
compared to real lighting engineers.Specifically, our method yields a p-value
of 0.72 in a statistical comparison based on human evaluations with human
lighting engineers, suggesting that the proposed approach closely matches human
lighting engineering performance. To support further research, we have made our
self-collected dataset, code, and trained model parameters available at

Abstract: Learning population dynamics involves recovering the underlying process that
governs particle evolution, given evolutionary snapshots of samples at discrete

combines the JKO framework with inverse optimization techniques to learn
population dynamics. Our method relies on a conventional $\textit{end-to-end}$
adversarial training procedure and does not require restrictive architectural
choices, e.g., input-convex neural networks. We establish theoretical
guarantees for our methodology and demonstrate improved performance over prior
JKO-based methods.

Result: 实验表明DIME能有效学习联合分布并捕捉多结果间的共享信息。

Conclusion: DIME是首个专注于医疗治疗多结果联合分布的神经网络方法，为临床决策提供更全面的支持。

Abstract: In medicine, treatments often influence multiple, interdependent outcomes,
such as primary endpoints, complications, adverse events, or other secondary
endpoints. Hence, to make optimal treatment decisions, clinicians are
interested in learning the distribution of multi-dimensional treatment
outcomes. However, the vast majority of machine learning methods for predicting
treatment effects focus on single-outcome settings, despite the fact that
medical data often include multiple, interdependent outcomes. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel diffusion-based method called DIME to learn the
joint distribution of multiple outcomes of medical treatments. We addresses
three challenges relevant in medical practice: (i)it is tailored to learn the
joint interventional distribution of multiple medical outcomes, which enables
reliable decision-making with uncertainty quantification rather than relying
solely on point estimates; (ii)it explicitly captures the dependence structure
between outcomes; (iii)it can handle outcomes of mixed type, including binary,
categorical, and continuous variables. In DIME, we take into account the
fundamental problem of causal inference through causal masking. For training,
our method decomposes the joint distribution into a series of conditional
distributions with a customized conditional masking to account for the
dependence structure across outcomes. For inference, our method
auto-regressively generates predictions. This allows our method to move beyond
point estimates of causal quantities and thus learn the joint interventional
distribution. To the best of our knowledge, DIME is the first neural method
tailored to learn the joint, multi-outcome distribution of medical treatments.
Across various experiments, we demonstrate that our method effectively learns
the joint distribution and captures shared information among multiple outcomes.

Conclusion: 位置编码在特定场景下能显著提升性能，但其效果因模型而异。

Abstract: Temporal graph learning has applications in recommendation systems, traffic
forecasting, and social network analysis. Although multiple architectures have
been introduced, progress in positional encoding for temporal graphs remains
limited. Extending static Laplacian eigenvector approaches to temporal graphs
through the supra-Laplacian has shown promise, but also poses key challenges:
high eigendecomposition costs, limited theoretical understanding, and ambiguity
about when and how to apply these encodings. In this paper, we address these
issues by (1) offering a theoretical framework that connects supra-Laplacian
encodings to per-time-slice encodings, highlighting the benefits of leveraging
additional temporal connectivity, (2) introducing novel methods to reduce the
computational overhead, achieving up to 56x faster runtimes while scaling to
graphs with 50,000 active nodes, and (3) conducting an extensive experimental
study to identify which models, tasks, and datasets benefit most from these
encodings. Our findings reveal that while positional encodings can
significantly boost performance in certain scenarios, their effectiveness
varies across different models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于RKHS的策略优化仅限于一阶方法，无法利用二阶优化方法的快速收敛优势，主要原因是无限维Hessian算子的计算和逆运算难以实现。

Method: 通过优化一个立方正则化的辅助目标函数，避免了直接计算逆Hessian算子，并利用Representer Theorem将无限维问题转化为有限维可计算问题。

Result: 理论证明了局部最优解的收敛性和局部二次收敛速率，实验验证了在收敛速度和奖励表现上优于现有的一阶RKHS方法和参数化二阶方法。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了非参数策略表示与二阶优化方法之间的关键空白，为强化学习提供了更高效的优化工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies represented in Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) offer powerful representational capabilities. While
second-order optimization methods like Newton's method demonstrate faster
convergence than first-order approaches, current RKHS-based policy optimization
remains constrained to first-order techniques. This limitation stems primarily
from the intractability of explicitly computing and inverting the
infinite-dimensional Hessian operator in RKHS. We introduce Policy Newton in
RKHS, the first second-order optimization framework specifically designed for
RL policies represented in RKHS. Our approach circumvents direct computation of
the inverse Hessian operator by optimizing a cubic regularized auxiliary
objective function. Crucially, we leverage the Representer Theorem to transform
this infinite-dimensional optimization into an equivalent, computationally
tractable finite-dimensional problem whose dimensionality scales with the
trajectory data volume. We establish theoretical guarantees proving convergence
to a local optimum with a local quadratic convergence rate. Empirical
evaluations on a toy financial asset allocation problem validate these
theoretical properties, while experiments on standard RL benchmarks demonstrate
that Policy Newton in RKHS achieves superior convergence speed and higher
episodic rewards compared to established first-order RKHS approaches and
parametric second-order methods. Our work bridges a critical gap between
non-parametric policy representations and second-order optimization methods in
reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于机器学习的UTXO区块链扩展方法，通过优化UTXO集分片和交易路由，减少跨分片通信开销，提升交易处理速度和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UTXO集分片方法在有效分配UTXO到验证节点方面存在困难，导致交易处理速度受限。

Method: 结合对比学习和无监督学习，构建交易输出的嵌入空间，通过历史交易数据训练模型，优化交易路由。

Result: 模型显著减少了跨分片通信开销，提高了交易吞吐量和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法为UTXO区块链的扩展提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a Machine Learning (ML) approach for scalability of
UTXO-based blockchains, such as Bitcoin. Prior approaches to UTXO set sharding
struggle with distributing UTXOs effectively across validators, creating
substantial communication overhead due to child-parent transaction
dependencies. This overhead, which arises from the need to locate parent UTXOs,
significantly hampers transaction processing speeds. Our solution uses ML to
optimize not only UTXO set sharding but also the routing of incoming
transactions, ensuring that transactions are directed to shards containing
their parent UTXOs. At the heart of our approach is a framework that combines
contrastive and unsupervised learning to create an embedding space for
transaction outputs. This embedding allows the model to group transaction
outputs based on spending relationships, making it possible to route
transactions efficiently to the correct validation microservices. Trained on
historical transaction data with triplet loss and online semi-hard negative
mining, the model embeds parent-child spending patterns directly into its
parameters, thus eliminating the need for costly, real-time parent transaction
lookups. This significantly reduces cross-shard communication overhead,
boosting throughput and scalability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在对抗性扰动下进行高斯过程优化的方法，目标是满足预设性能阈值，而非传统的最坏情况优化。提出了两种新算法，并展示了其在不同对抗条件下的性能保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鲁棒优化方法关注最坏情况下的性能最大化，但在对抗性扰动未知或变化时可能不适用。本文旨在实现预设性能阈值的鲁棒满足目标。

Method: 提出了两种基于鲁棒满足目标的新算法，分别针对不同对抗条件，并推导了两种遗憾界限。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在满足性能阈值方面优于传统鲁棒优化方法，尤其是在模糊集不准确时。

Conclusion: 提出的鲁棒满足框架在对抗性扰动下更有效，且算法性能依赖于对抗条件和预设阈值。

Abstract: We address the problem of Gaussian Process (GP) optimization in the presence
of unknown and potentially varying adversarial perturbations. Unlike
traditional robust optimization approaches that focus on maximizing performance
under worst-case scenarios, we consider a robust satisficing objective, where
the goal is to consistently achieve a predefined performance threshold $\tau$,
even under adversarial conditions. We propose two novel algorithms based on
distinct formulations of robust satisficing, and show that they are instances
of a general robust satisficing framework. Further, each algorithm offers
different guarantees depending on the nature of the adversary. Specifically, we
derive two regret bounds: one that is sublinear over time, assuming certain
conditions on the adversary and the satisficing threshold $\tau$, and another
that scales with the perturbation magnitude but requires no assumptions on the
adversary. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the established robust optimization methods in achieving the
satisficing objective, particularly when the ambiguity set of the robust
optimization framework is inaccurately specified.

*Zehao Wu,Yanjie Zhao,Haoyu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TensorGuard是一种基于梯度的指纹框架，用于检测LLM的相似性和家族分类，填补了LLM溯源和许可证合规的技术空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM成为现代应用的关键组件，未经授权的模型衍生（如微调、合并和重新分发）成为重要挑战。当前缺乏有效机制检测模型谱系和执行许可证协议。

Method: TensorGuard通过分析梯度响应随机输入扰动的行为特征，提取模型内在签名，支持safetensors格式，并通过统计分析和K-Means聚类实现相似性评估和家族分类。

Result: 在58个模型（8个基础模型和50个衍生模型）的实验中，TensorGuard的K-Means聚类分类准确率达到94%。

Conclusion: TensorGuard为LLM的溯源和许可证合规提供了有效的技术手段，填补了现有生态系统的空白。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral software components in modern
applications, unauthorized model derivations through fine-tuning, merging, and
redistribution have emerged as critical software engineering challenges. Unlike
traditional software where clone detection and license compliance are
well-established, the LLM ecosystem lacks effective mechanisms to detect model
lineage and enforce licensing agreements. This gap is particularly problematic
when open-source model creators, such as Meta's LLaMA, require derivative works
to maintain naming conventions for attribution, yet no technical means exist to
verify compliance.
  To fill this gap, treating LLMs as software artifacts requiring provenance
tracking, we present TensorGuard, a gradient-based fingerprinting framework for
LLM similarity detection and family classification. Our approach extracts
model-intrinsic behavioral signatures by analyzing gradient responses to random
input perturbations across tensor layers, operating independently of training
data, watermarks, or specific model formats. TensorGuard supports the
widely-adopted safetensors format and constructs high-dimensional fingerprints
through statistical analysis of gradient features. These fingerprints enable
two complementary capabilities: direct pairwise similarity assessment between
arbitrary models through distance computation, and systematic family
classification of unknown models via the K-Means clustering algorithm with
domain-informed centroid initialization using known base models. Experimental
evaluation on 58 models comprising 8 base models and 50 derivatives across five
model families (Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Phi, Mistral) demonstrates 94%
classification accuracy under our centroid-initialized K-Means clustering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)算法中使用正向KL散度的替代方法，提出Bidirectional SAC，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SAC依赖反向KL散度进行策略更新，导致不稳定和样本效率低。

Method: 提出Bidirectional SAC，先用正向KL散度初始化策略，再用反向KL散度优化。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，Bidirectional SAC表现优于标准SAC，奖励提升30%。

Conclusion: 正向KL散度与反向KL散度结合的策略显著提升了SAC的性能和样本效率。

Abstract: The Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, a state-of-the-art method in maximum
entropy reinforcement learning, traditionally relies on minimizing reverse
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for policy updates. However, this approach
leads to an intractable optimal projection policy, necessitating gradient-based
approximations that can suffer from instability and poor sample efficiency.
This paper investigates the alternative use of forward KL divergence within
SAC. We demonstrate that for Gaussian policies, forward KL divergence yields an
explicit optimal projection policy -- corresponding to the mean and variance of
the target Boltzmann distribution's action marginals. Building on the distinct
advantages of both KL directions, we propose Bidirectional SAC, an algorithm
that first initializes the policy using the explicit forward KL projection and
then refines it by optimizing the reverse KL divergence. Comprehensive
experiments on continuous control benchmarks show that Bidirectional SAC
significantly outperforms standard SAC and other baselines, achieving up to a
$30\%$ increase in episodic rewards, alongside enhanced sample efficiency.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了分析梯度强化学习安全保障的空白，为安全关键应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying autonomous robots in safety-critical applications requires safety
guarantees. Provably safe reinforcement learning is an active field of research
which aims to provide such guarantees using safeguards. These safeguards should
be integrated during training to prevent a large sim-to-real gap. While there
are several approaches for safeguarding sampling-based reinforcement learning,
analytic gradient-based reinforcement learning often achieves superior
performance and sample efficiency. However, there is no safeguarding approach
for this learning paradigm yet. Our work addresses this gap by developing the
first effective safeguard for analytic gradient-based reinforcement learning.
We analyse existing, differentiable safeguards, adapt them through modified
mappings and gradient formulations, and integrate them with a state-of-the-art
learning algorithm and a differentiable simulation. We evaluate how different
safeguards affect policy optimisation using numerical experiments on two
classical control tasks. The results demonstrate safeguarded training without
compromising performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺情况下，现有的学习优化方法（L2O）对复杂优化问题（如QPs）的鲁棒性不足，需要一种有效的数据增强策略。

Method: 通过理论支持的数据增强技术生成多样性且保持最优性的实例，并结合对比学习的自监督框架预训练MPNNs。

Conclusion: 提出的数据增强和自监督学习框架显著提升了MPNNs在L2O任务中的性能，尤其在数据稀缺和复杂优化问题中表现优异。

Abstract: Linear and quadratic optimization are crucial in numerous real-world
applications, from training machine learning models to integer-linear
optimization. Recently, learning-to-optimize methods (L2O) for linear (LPs) or
quadratic programs (QPs) using message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs)
have gained traction, promising lightweight, data-driven proxies for solving
such optimization problems. For example, they replace the costly computation of
strong branching scores in branch-and-bound solvers, requiring solving many
such optimization problems. However, robust L2O MPNNs remain challenging in
data-scarce settings, especially when addressing complex optimization problems
such as QPs. This work introduces a principled approach to data augmentation
tailored for QPs via MPNNs. Our method leverages theoretically justified data
augmentation techniques to generate diverse yet optimality-preserving
instances. Furthermore, we integrate these augmentations into a self-supervised
learning framework based on contrastive learning, thereby pretraining MPNNs for
enhanced performance on L2O tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach improves generalization in supervised scenarios and facilitates
effective transfer learning to related optimization problems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合客户查询和订单状态上下文信息的上下文感知NLU模型（MTL-CNLU-SAWC），通过选择性注意力模块和多任务学习，显著提高了意图分类的准确性，减少了人工干预需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有意图分类模型仅依赖客户查询，难以处理模糊查询，导致准确性低。结合上下文信息（如订单状态）可以更准确地识别意图。

Method: 提出MTL-CNLU-SAWC模型，结合选择性注意力模块提取相关上下文特征，并采用多任务学习利用不同标签类型。

Result: 模型在Top 2准确率上比仅使用查询的基线模型提高4.8%，比现有结合查询和上下文的最先进模型提高3.5%。

Conclusion: MTL-CNLU-SAWC显著提升了意图分类准确性，减少了人工干预，为公司节省了每年近百万美元的成本。

Abstract: Customer service chatbots are conversational systems aimed at addressing
customer queries, often by directing them to automated workflows. A crucial
aspect of this process is the classification of the customer's intent.
Presently, most intent classification models for customer care utilise only
customer query for intent prediction. This may result in low-accuracy models,
which cannot handle ambiguous queries. An ambiguous query like "I didn't
receive my package" could indicate a delayed order, or an order that was
delivered but the customer failed to receive it. Resolution of each of these
scenarios requires the execution of very different sequence of steps. Utilizing
additional information, such as the customer's order delivery status, in the
right manner can help identify the intent for such ambiguous queries. In this
paper, we have introduced a context-aware NLU model that incorporates both, the
customer query and contextual information from the customer's order status for
predicting customer intent. A novel selective attention module is used to
extract relevant context features. We have also proposed a multi-task learning
paradigm for the effective utilization of different label types available in
our training data. Our suggested method, Multi-Task Learning Contextual NLU
with Selective Attention Weighted Context (MTL-CNLU-SAWC), yields a 4.8%
increase in top 2 accuracy score over the baseline model which only uses user
queries, and a 3.5% improvement over existing state-of-the-art models that
combine query and context. We have deployed our model to production for
Walmart's customer care domain. Accurate intent prediction through
MTL-CNLU-SAWC helps to better direct customers to automated workflows, thereby
significantly reducing escalations to human agents, leading to almost a million
dollars in yearly savings for the company.

knowledge distillation, and dynamic architecture design that enable incremental
model updates without full retraining. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive
taxonomy of frugal methods, discusses case studies across diverse domains, and
identifies future research directions to drive innovation in this evolving

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如强化学习和BAI技术）在适应性探索策略设计上存在局限性，尤其是信息结构表达不足或依赖显式建模假设。

Result: 在合成和半合成基准测试中，ICPE在确定性、随机和结构化场景中均表现出稳健性能，匹配最优算法。

Conclusion: ICPE是一种实用且通用的数据高效探索方法，仅依赖深度学习技术即可实现高性能。

Abstract: In this work, we study the active sequential hypothesis testing problem, also
known as pure exploration, where the goal is to actively control a data
collection process to efficiently identify the correct hypothesis underlying a
decision problem. While relevant across multiple domains, devising adaptive
exploration strategies remains challenging, particularly due to difficulties in
encoding appropriate inductive biases. Existing Reinforcement Learning
(RL)-based methods often underperform when relevant information structures are
inadequately represented, whereas more complex methods, like Best Arm
Identification (BAI) techniques, may be difficult to devise and typically rely
on explicit modeling assumptions. To address these limitations, we introduce
In-Context Pure Exploration (ICPE), an in-context learning approach that uses
Transformers to learn exploration strategies directly from experience. ICPE
combines supervised learning and reinforcement learning to identify and exploit
latent structure across related tasks, without requiring prior assumptions.
Numerical results across diverse synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks
highlight ICPE's capability to achieve robust performance performance in
deterministic, stochastic, and structured settings. These results demonstrate
ICPE's ability to match optimal instance-dependent algorithms using only deep
learning techniques, making it a practical and general approach to
data-efficient exploration.

Motivation: 现代单细胞数据集规模庞大，现有数据加载方案存在内存占用高、存储需求大或随机磁盘访问慢的问题，亟需高效解决方案。

Method: 结合块采样和批量获取技术，直接在AnnData文件上操作，避免格式转换和内存占用问题。

Result: 在Tahoe 100M数据集上，scDataset比AnnLoader快48倍，比HuggingFace Datasets快27倍，比BioNeMo快18倍。

Conclusion: scDataset为研究社区提供了高效的大规模单细胞模型训练工具。

Abstract: Modern single-cell datasets now comprise hundreds of millions of cells,
presenting significant challenges for training deep learning models that
require shuffled, memory-efficient data loading. While the AnnData format is
the community standard for storing single-cell datasets, existing data loading
solutions for AnnData are often inadequate: some require loading all data into
memory, others convert to dense formats that increase storage demands, and many
are hampered by slow random disk access. We present scDataset, a PyTorch
IterableDataset that operates directly on one or more AnnData files without the
need for format conversion. The core innovation is a combination of block
sampling and batched fetching, which together balance randomness and I/O
efficiency. On the Tahoe 100M dataset, scDataset achieves up to a 48$\times$
speed-up over AnnLoader, a 27$\times$ speed-up over HuggingFace Datasets, and
an 18$\times$ speed-up over BioNeMo in single-core settings. These advances
democratize large-scale single-cell model training for the broader research
community.

Conclusion: 研究为RL在大型状态空间中的统计复杂性提供了理论框架，并指出了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated tremendous empirical success
across numerous challenging domains. However, we lack a strong theoretical
understanding of the statistical complexity of RL in environments with large
state spaces, where function approximation is required for sample-efficient
learning. This thesis addresses this gap by rigorously examining the
statistical complexity of RL with function approximation from a learning
theoretic perspective. Departing from a long history of prior work, we consider
the weakest form of function approximation, called agnostic policy learning, in
which the learner seeks to find the best policy in a given class $\Pi$, with no
guarantee that $\Pi$ contains an optimal policy for the underlying task.
  We systematically explore agnostic policy learning along three key axes:
environment access -- how a learner collects data from the environment;
coverage conditions -- intrinsic properties of the underlying MDP measuring the
expansiveness of state-occupancy measures for policies in the class $\Pi$, and
representational conditions -- structural assumptions on the class $\Pi$
itself. Within this comprehensive framework, we (1) design new learning
algorithms with theoretical guarantees and (2) characterize fundamental
performance bounds of any algorithm. Our results reveal significant statistical
separations that highlight the power and limitations of agnostic policy
learning.

Conclusion: 细粒度对齐、注意力融合和韵律建模显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease is
critical for enabling timely clinical intervention and improving patient
outcomes. In this work, we introduce CogniAlign, a multimodal architecture for
Alzheimer's detection that integrates audio and textual modalities, two
non-intrusive sources of information that offer complementary insights into
cognitive health. Unlike prior approaches that fuse modalities at a coarse
level, CogniAlign leverages a word-level temporal alignment strategy that
synchronizes audio embeddings with corresponding textual tokens based on
transcription timestamps. This alignment supports the development of
token-level fusion techniques, enabling more precise cross-modal interactions.
To fully exploit this alignment, we propose a Gated Cross-Attention Fusion
mechanism, where audio features attend over textual representations, guided by
the superior unimodal performance of the text modality. In addition, we
incorporate prosodic cues, specifically interword pauses, by inserting pause
tokens into the text and generating audio embeddings for silent intervals,
further enriching both streams. We evaluate CogniAlign on the ADReSSo dataset,
where it achieves an accuracy of 90.36%, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods. A detailed ablation study confirms the advantages of
our alignment strategy, attention-based fusion, and prosodic modeling.

Abstract: Transformer based models have shown remarkable capabilities in sequence
learning across a wide range of tasks, often performing well on specific task
by leveraging input-output examples. Despite their empirical success, a
comprehensive theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. In
this work, we investigate the layerwise behavior of Transformers to uncover the
mechanisms underlying their multi-task generalization ability. Taking
explorations on a typical sequence model, i.e, Hidden Markov Models, which are
fundamental to many language tasks, we observe that: first, lower layers of
Transformers focus on extracting feature representations, primarily influenced
by neighboring tokens; second, on the upper layers, features become decoupled,
exhibiting a high degree of time disentanglement. Building on these empirical
insights, we provide theoretical analysis for the expressiveness power of
Transformers. Our explicit constructions align closely with empirical
observations, providing theoretical support for the Transformer's effectiveness
and efficiency on sequence learning across diverse tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因全局约束（如图连通性或无环性）难以有效编码和求解，无法扩展到大规模问题。

Method: 提出新的SAT编码方法，用简单的局部约束替代全局约束，优化传播性能。

Result: 新方法将计算和枚举的规模显著提升：两盒展开面积从88扩展到150，枚举从30扩展到60，并否定了Xu等人的猜想。

Conclusion: 新方法解决了现有技术的扩展性问题，为多面体展开研究提供了更高效的工具。

Abstract: We consider the problem of finding and enumerating polyominos that can be
folded into multiple non-isomorphic boxes. While several computational
approaches have been proposed, including SAT, randomized algorithms, and
decision diagrams, none has been able to perform at scale. We argue that
existing SAT encodings are hindered by the presence of global constraints
(e.g., graph connectivity or acyclicity), which are generally hard to encode
effectively and hard for solvers to reason about. In this work, we propose a
new SAT-based approach that replaces these global constraints with simple local
constraints that have substantially better propagation properties. Our approach
dramatically improves the scalability of both computing and enumerating common
box unfoldings: (i) while previous approaches could only find common unfoldings
of two boxes up to area 88, ours easily scales beyond 150, and (ii) while
previous approaches were only able to enumerate common unfoldings up to area
30, ours scales up to 60. This allows us to rule out 46, 54, and 58 as the
smallest areas allowing a common unfolding of three boxes, thereby refuting a
conjecture of Xu et al. (2017).

TL;DR: 比较了MiniLM-v6和BGE-Large在RAG系统中的嵌入模型性能，发现MiniLM-v6在混合检索中表现更优，尤其在LLM重排序场景下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态嵌入模型在RAG系统中的性能差异，挑战传统认为更大模型性能更好的假设。

Method: 融合稠密语义、稀疏词法和图嵌入，测试MiniLM-v6和BGE-Large在SciFact、FIQA和NFCorpus数据集上的表现。

Result: MiniLM-v6在混合框架中优于BGE-Large，尤其在LLM重排序时表现更佳。

Conclusion: RAG系统应优先选择与多信号融合和LLM对齐兼容的嵌入模型，而非仅依赖大模型。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparison of embedding models in tri-modal hybrid
retrieval for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. We investigate the
fusion of dense semantic, sparse lexical, and graph-based embeddings, focusing
on the performance of the MiniLM-v6 and BGE-Large architectures. Contrary to
conventional assumptions, our results show that the compact MiniLM-v6
outperforms the larger BGE-Large when integrated with LLM-based re-ranking
within our tri-modal hybrid framework. Experiments conducted on the SciFact,
FIQA, and NFCorpus datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval
quality with the MiniLM-v6 configuration. The performance difference is
particularly pronounced in agentic re-ranking scenarios, indicating better
alignment between MiniLM-v6's embedding space and LLM reasoning. Our findings
suggest that embedding model selection for RAG systems should prioritize
compatibility with multi-signal fusion and LLM alignment, rather than relying
solely on larger models. This approach may reduce computational requirements
while improving retrieval accuracy and efficiency.

TL;DR: RLMultimodalRec是一个轻量级的多模态推荐框架，通过动态融合视觉和文本模态，结合图神经网络，显著提升了推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统协同过滤中的冷启动和数据稀疏问题，同时避免现有方法中固定融合策略或复杂架构的不足。

Method: 结合图用户建模与自适应多模态项目编码，使用门控融合模块动态平衡模态贡献，并采用LightGCN捕捉高阶协同信号。

Result: 在亚马逊数据集上，RLMultimodalRec优于多种基线方法，显著提升了Top-K推荐指标。

Conclusion: 该框架兼具高性能、可扩展性和可解释性，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation has emerged as a promising solution to alleviate
the cold-start and sparsity problems in collaborative filtering by
incorporating rich content information, such as product images and textual
descriptions. However, effectively integrating heterogeneous modalities into a
unified recommendation framework remains a challenge. Existing approaches often
rely on fixed fusion strategies or complex architectures , which may fail to
adapt to modality quality variance or introduce unnecessary computational
overhead.
  In this work, we propose RLMultimodalRec, a lightweight and modular
recommendation framework that combines graph-based user modeling with adaptive
multimodal item encoding. The model employs a gated fusion module to
dynamically balance the contribution of visual and textual modalities, enabling
fine-grained and content-aware item representations. Meanwhile, a two-layer
LightGCN encoder captures high-order collaborative signals by propagating
embeddings over the user-item interaction graph without relying on nonlinear
transformations.
  We evaluate our model on a real-world dataset from the Amazon product domain.
Experimental results demonstrate that RLMultimodalRec consistently outperforms
several competitive baselines, including collaborative filtering, visual-aware,
and multimodal GNN-based methods. The proposed approach achieves significant
improvements in top-K recommendation metrics while maintaining scalability and
interpretability, making it suitable for practical deployment.

<details>

Motivation: 生成式检索避免了构建辅助索引结构的复杂性，但面临预训练模型与标识符知识不匹配以及训练与推理差距的挑战。

Method: GLEN采用两阶段索引学习策略，动态生成词汇标识符，并在推理阶段利用标识符权重进行无冲突排序。

Result: GLEN在NQ320k、MS MARCO和BEIR等基准数据集上达到了最先进或竞争性性能。

Conclusion: GLEN通过动态词汇标识符学习和无冲突推理，有效解决了生成式检索的关键挑战，性能优越。

Abstract: Generative retrieval shed light on a new paradigm of document retrieval,
aiming to directly generate the identifier of a relevant document for a query.
While it takes advantage of bypassing the construction of auxiliary index
structures, existing studies face two significant challenges: (i) the
discrepancy between the knowledge of pre-trained language models and
identifiers and (ii) the gap between training and inference that poses
difficulty in learning to rank. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
novel generative retrieval method, namely Generative retrieval via LExical
iNdex learning (GLEN). For training, GLEN effectively exploits a dynamic
lexical identifier using a two-phase index learning strategy, enabling it to
learn meaningful lexical identifiers and relevance signals between queries and
documents. For inference, GLEN utilizes collision-free inference, using
identifier weights to rank documents without additional overhead. Experimental
results prove that GLEN achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance
against existing generative retrieval methods on various benchmark datasets,
e.g., NQ320k, MS MARCO, and BEIR. The code is available at

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to
enhance large language models (LLMs) by conditioning generation on external
evidence retrieved at inference time. While RAG addresses critical limitations
of parametric knowledge storage-such as factual inconsistency and domain
inflexibility-it introduces new challenges in retrieval quality, grounding
fidelity, pipeline efficiency, and robustness against noisy or adversarial
inputs. This survey provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent advances in
RAG systems, offering a taxonomy that categorizes architectures into
retriever-centric, generator-centric, hybrid, and robustness-oriented designs.
We systematically analyze enhancements across retrieval optimization, context
filtering, decoding control, and efficiency improvements, supported by
comparative performance analyses on short-form and multi-hop question answering
tasks. Furthermore, we review state-of-the-art evaluation frameworks and
benchmarks, highlighting trends in retrieval-aware evaluation, robustness
testing, and federated retrieval settings. Our analysis reveals recurring
trade-offs between retrieval precision and generation flexibility, efficiency
and faithfulness, and modularity and coordination. We conclude by identifying
open challenges and future research directions, including adaptive retrieval
architectures, real-time retrieval integration, structured reasoning over
multi-hop evidence, and privacy-preserving retrieval mechanisms. This survey
aims to consolidate current knowledge in RAG research and serve as a foundation
for the next generation of retrieval-augmented language modeling systems.

Method: 提出GPR，直接在知识图谱上预训练，通过LLM引导的图增强对齐自然语言问题与相关子图，并采用结构感知目标学习细粒度检索策略。

Result: 在两个数据集、三个LLM主干和五个基线上的实验表明，GPR显著提升了检索质量和下游生成效果。

Conclusion: GPR是一种有效的图检索增强生成解决方案，具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GRAG) places high demands on
graph-specific retrievers. However, existing retrievers often rely on language
models pretrained on plain text, limiting their effectiveness due to domain
misalignment and structure ignorance. To address these challenges, we propose
GPR, a graph-based retriever pretrained directly on knowledge graphs. GPR
aligns natural language questions with relevant subgraphs through LLM-guided
graph augmentation and employs a structure-aware objective to learn
fine-grained retrieval strategies. Experiments on two datasets, three LLM
backbones, and five baselines show that GPR consistently improves both
retrieval quality and downstream generation, demonstrating its effectiveness as
a robust retrieval solution for GRAG.

Motivation: 通用文本嵌入模型在私有数据集（如公司专有数据）上表现不佳，因其包含专业术语和行话。

Result: 在多个领域、数据集和模型上均表现出检索性能的显著提升。

Conclusion: BM25信号通过增强对齐性和一致性改进嵌入，为领域特定数据适配提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Text embedding models play a cornerstone role in AI applications, such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While general-purpose text embedding
models demonstrate strong performance on generic retrieval benchmarks, their
effectiveness diminishes when applied to private datasets (e.g.,
company-specific proprietary data), which often contain specialized terminology
and lingo. In this work, we introduce BMEmbed, a novel method for adapting
general-purpose text embedding models to private datasets. By leveraging the
well-established keyword-based retrieval technique (BM25), we construct
supervisory signals from the ranking of keyword-based retrieval results to
facilitate model adaptation. We evaluate BMEmbed across a range of domains,
datasets, and models, showing consistent improvements in retrieval performance.
Moreover, we provide empirical insights into how BM25-based signals contribute
to improving embeddings by fostering alignment and uniformity, highlighting the
value of this approach in adapting models to domain-specific data. We release
the source code available at https://github.com/BaileyWei/BMEmbed for the

TL;DR: Conv2Query框架通过将对话上下文映射为ad-hoc查询，解决了PSC中输入不匹配的问题，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PSC中直接使用ad-hoc检索器时，输入的长文本与预训练的短查询不匹配，限制了检索质量。

Method: 提出Conv2Query框架，将对话上下文转换为ad-hoc查询，适配ad-hoc检索器。

Result: 在两个PSC数据集上的实验表明，Conv2Query显著提升了检索性能。

Conclusion: Conv2Query有效解决了PSC中的输入不匹配问题，提升了检索效果。

Abstract: Proactive search in conversations (PSC) aims to reduce user effort in
formulating explicit queries by proactively retrieving useful relevant
information given conversational context. Previous work in PSC either directly
uses this context as input to off-the-shelf ad-hoc retrievers or further
fine-tunes them on PSC data. However, ad-hoc retrievers are pre-trained on
short and concise queries, while the PSC input is longer and noisier. This
input mismatch between ad-hoc search and PSC limits retrieval quality. While
fine-tuning on PSC data helps, its benefits remain constrained by this input
gap. In this work, we propose Conv2Query, a novel conversation-to-query
framework that adapts ad-hoc retrievers to PSC by bridging the input gap
between ad-hoc search and PSC. Conv2Query maps conversational context into
ad-hoc queries, which can either be used as input for off-the-shelf ad-hoc
retrievers or for further fine-tuning on PSC data. Extensive experiments on two
PSC datasets show that Conv2Query significantly improves ad-hoc retrievers'
performance, both when used directly and after fine-tuning on PSC.

Conclusion: GRAM通过创新技术显著提升了生成式推荐性能，解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Generative recommendation is an emerging paradigm that leverages the
extensive knowledge of large language models by formulating recommendations
into a text-to-text generation task. However, existing studies face two key
limitations in (i) incorporating implicit item relationships and (ii) utilizing
rich yet lengthy item information. To address these challenges, we propose a
Generative Recommender via semantic-Aware Multi-granular late fusion (GRAM),
introducing two synergistic innovations. First, we design semantic-to-lexical
translation to encode implicit hierarchical and collaborative item
relationships into the vocabulary space of LLMs. Second, we present
multi-granular late fusion to integrate rich semantics efficiently with minimal
information loss. It employs separate encoders for multi-granular prompts,
delaying the fusion until the decoding stage. Experiments on four benchmark
datasets show that GRAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art generative
recommendation models, achieving significant improvements of 11.5-16.0% in
Recall@5 and 5.3-13.6% in NDCG@5. The source code is available at

Method: 提出了GradNormIR方法，利用梯度范数无监督地检测文档库是否超出分布范围。

Result: 在BEIR基准测试中，GradNormIR显著提升了检索器的鲁棒性和效率。

Conclusion: GradNormIR能够有效预测文档库的分布偏移，为密集检索器的及时更新提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Dense retrievers encode texts into embeddings to efficiently retrieve
relevant documents from large databases in response to user queries. However,
real-world corpora continually evolve, leading to a shift from the original
training distribution of the retriever. Without timely updates or retraining,
indexing newly emerging documents can degrade retrieval performance for future
queries. Thus, identifying when a dense retriever requires an update is
critical for maintaining robust retrieval systems. In this paper, we propose a
novel task of predicting whether a corpus is out-of-distribution (OOD) relative
to a dense retriever before indexing. Addressing this task allows us to
proactively manage retriever updates, preventing potential retrieval failures.
We introduce GradNormIR, an unsupervised approach that leverages gradient norms
to detect OOD corpora effectively. Experiments on the BEIR benchmark
demonstrate that GradNormIR enables timely updates of dense retrievers in
evolving document collections, significantly enhancing retrieval robustness and
efficiency.

Conclusion: PathGene和评估的方法为肺癌早期遗传筛查和精准治疗提供了新途径。

Abstract: Accurately predicting gene mutations, mutation subtypes and their exons in
lung cancer is critical for personalized treatment planning and prognostic
assessment. Faced with regional disparities in medical resources and the high
cost of genomic assays, using artificial intelligence to infer these mutations
and exon variants from routine histopathology images could greatly facilitate
precision therapy. Although some prior studies have shown that deep learning
can accelerate the prediction of key gene mutations from lung cancer pathology
slides, their performance remains suboptimal and has so far been limited mainly
to early screening tasks. To address these limitations, we have assembled
PathGene, which comprises histopathology images paired with next-generation
sequencing reports from 1,576 patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central
South University, and 448 TCGA-LUAD patients. This multi-center dataset links
whole-slide images to driver gene mutation status, mutation subtypes, exon, and
tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, with the goal of leveraging pathology
images to predict mutations, subtypes, exon locations, and TMB for early
genetic screening and to advance precision oncology. Unlike existing datasets,
we provide molecular-level information related to histopathology images in
PathGene to facilitate the development of biomarker prediction models. We
benchmarked 11 multiple-instance learning methods on PathGene for mutation,
subtype, exon, and TMB prediction tasks. These experimental methods provide
valuable alternatives for early genetic screening of lung cancer patients and
assisting clinicians to quickly develop personalized precision targeted
treatment plans for patients. Code and data are available at

Conclusion: GenDMR为多模态数据融合技术提供了新的可解释性分析能力，为AD研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that integrating multimodal data fusion techniques
for imaging and genetic features is beneficial for the etiological analysis and
predictive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there are several
critical flaws in current deep learning methods. Firstly, there has been
insufficient discussion and exploration regarding the selection and encoding of
genetic information. Secondly, due to the significantly superior classification
value of AD imaging features compared to genetic features, many studies in
multimodal fusion emphasize the strengths of imaging features, actively
mitigating the influence of weaker features, thereby diminishing the learning
of the unique value of genetic features. To address this issue, this study
proposes the dynamic multimodal role-swapping network (GenDMR). In GenDMR, we
develop a novel approach to encode the spatial organization of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), enhancing the representation of their genomic
context. Additionally, to adaptively quantify the disease risk of SNPs and
brain region, we propose a multi-instance attention module to enhance model
interpretability. Furthermore, we introduce a dominant modality selection
module and a contrastive self-distillation module, combining them to achieve a
dynamic teacher-student role exchange mechanism based on dominant and auxiliary
modalities for bidirectional co-updating of different modal data. Finally,
GenDMR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ADNI public dataset and
visualizes attention to different SNPs, focusing on confirming 12 potential
high-risk genes related to AD, including the most classic APOE and recently
highlighted significant risk genes. This demonstrates GenDMR's interpretable
analytical capability in exploring AD genetic features, providing new insights
and perspectives for the development of multimodal data fusion techniques.

Conclusion: 该方法为量子电路合成提供了新工具，并可能启发新的启发式方法。

Abstract: Efficiently compiling quantum operations remains a major bottleneck in
scaling quantum computing. Today's state-of-the-art methods achieve low
compilation error by combining search algorithms with gradient-based parameter
optimization, but they incur long runtimes and require multiple calls to
quantum hardware or expensive classical simulations, making their scaling
prohibitive. Recently, machine-learning models have emerged as an alternative,
though they are currently restricted to discrete gate sets. Here, we introduce
a multimodal denoising diffusion model that simultaneously generates a
circuit's structure and its continuous parameters for compiling a target
unitary. It leverages two independent diffusion processes, one for discrete
gate selection and one for parameter prediction. We benchmark the model over
different experiments, analyzing the method's accuracy across varying qubit
counts, circuit depths, and proportions of parameterized gates. Finally, by
exploiting its rapid circuit generation, we create large datasets of circuits
for particular operations and use these to extract valuable heuristics that can
help us discover new insights into quantum circuit synthesis.

these machine learning models using the framework of quantum information
theory, leading to the introduction of positive unital circuits (PUnCs), which
generalize circuit evaluations over positive real-valued probabilities to

PUnCs strictly generalize probabilistic circuits as well as recently introduced

Abstract: We apply pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs), originally developed for
image recognition, to the analysis of astronomical spectral data. By converting
traditional one-dimensional spectra into two-dimensional image representations,
we enable ViTs to capture both local and global spectral features through
spatial self-attention. We fine-tune a ViT pretrained on ImageNet using
millions of spectra from the SDSS and LAMOST surveys, represented as spectral
plots. Our model is evaluated on key tasks including stellar object
classification and redshift ($z$) estimation, where it demonstrates strong
performance and scalability. We achieve classification accuracy higher than
Support Vector Machines and Random Forests, and attain $R^2$ values comparable
to AstroCLIP's spectrum encoder, even when generalizing across diverse object
types. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using pretrained vision
models for spectroscopic data analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first
application of ViTs to large-scale, which also leverages real spectroscopic

Abstract: We introduce a concise, topologically-motivated semantics for finite
dialogues by mapping each utterance to an open set in a fixed semantic space,
building the corresponding nerve complex of joint satisfiability, and
extracting fundamental combinatorial invariants:
  1. The negative nerve, which enumerates all finite collections of utterances
whose
  opens have empty intersection, providing a straightforward criterion for
merging
  separate transcripts without contradiction.
  2. The global interpretation subspace, the unique minimal open in which all
asserted
  utterances hold simultaneously, enabling effective enumeration of all logical
  consequences of the entire dialogue.
  3. A practical demonstration in the Wolfram Language, with algorithms for
constructing
  nerves, detecting inconsistencies, and computing the global interpretation,
thereby
  illustrating computational feasibility.
  Our framework is grounded in classical duality and topological semantics
(Stone duality, Priestley duality, Tarski's semantics, coherence-space methods,
Scott domains, topos semantics, and homotopy type theory) while drawing on
recent advances in topological data analysis and dialogue-based semantics.

Abstract: The Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem lies at the core of many
applications in combinatorial optimization, software verification,
cryptography, and machine learning. While state-of-the-art solvers have
demonstrated high efficiency in handling conjunctive normal form (CNF)
formulas, numerous applications require non-CNF (hybrid) constraints, such as
XOR, cardinality, and Not-All-Equal constraints. Recent work leverages
polynomial representations to represent such hybrid constraints, but it relies
on box constraints that can limit the use of powerful unconstrained optimizers.
In this paper, we propose unconstrained continuous optimization formulations
for hybrid SAT solving by penalty terms. We provide theoretical insights into
when these penalty terms are necessary and demonstrate empirically that
unconstrained optimizers (e.g., Adam) can enhance SAT solving on hybrid
benchmarks. Our results highlight the potential of combining continuous
optimization and machine-learning-based methods for effective hybrid SAT
solving.
